> AT Protocol Reference Implementation (TypeScript) 
>  Welcome friends! 
>  This repository contains Bluesky's reference implementation of AT Protocol, and of the app.bsky microblogging application service backend. 
>  What is in here? 
>  TypeScript Packages: 
>  TypeScript Services: 
>  
>  pds : "Personal Data Server", hosting repo content for atproto accounts. Most implementation code in packages/pds , with runtime wrapper in services/pds . See bluesky-social/pds for directions on self-hosting. 
>  bsky : AppView implementation of the app.bsky.* API endpoints. Running on main network at api.bsky.app . Most implementation code in packages/bsky , with runtime wrapper in services/bsky . 
>  
>  Lexicons: for both the com.atproto.* and app.bsky.* are canonically versioned in this repo, for now, under ./lexicons/ . These are JSON files in the Lexicon schema definition language , similar to JSON Schema or OpenAPI. 
>  Interoperability Test Data: the language-neutral test files in ./interop-test-files/ may be useful for other protocol implementations to ensure that they follow the specification correctly 
>  The source code for the Bluesky Social client app (for web and mobile) can be found at bluesky-social/social-app . 
>  Go programming language source code is in bluesky-social/indigo , including the BGS implementation. 
>  Developer Quickstart 
>  We recommend nvm for managing Node.js installs. This project requires Node.js version 18. pnpm is used to manage the workspace of multiple packages. You can install it with npm install --global pnpm . 
>  There is a Makefile which can help with basic development tasks: 
>  # use existing nvm to install node 18 and pnpm 
> make nvm-setup
>  # pull dependencies and build all local packages 
> make deps
> make build
>  # run the tests, using Docker services as needed 
> make test 
>  # run a local PDS and AppView with fake test accounts and data 
>  # (this requires a global installation of `jq` and `docker`) 
> make run-dev-env
>  # show all other commands 
> make help

>  Overview and Guides 👈 Best starting point 
>  Github Discussions 👈 Great place to ask questions 
>  Protocol Specifications 
>  Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures

>  Guidelines: 
>  
>  Check for existing issues before filing a new one, please. 
>  Open an issue and give some time for discussion before submitting a PR. 
>  If submitting a PR that includes a lexicon change, please get sign off on the lexicon change before doing the implementation. 
>  Issues are for bugs &amp; feature requests related to the TypeScript implementation of atproto and related services.

>  
>  Stay away from PRs that:
>  
>  Refactor large parts of the codebase 
>  Add entirely new features without prior discussion 
>  Change the tooling or frameworks used without prior discussion 
>  Introduce new unnecessary dependencies 
>  
>  
>  
>  Remember, we serve a wide community of users. Our day-to-day involves us constantly asking "which top priority is our top priority." If you submit well-written PRs that solve problems concisely, that's an awesome contribution. Otherwise, as much as we'd love to accept your ideas and contributions, we really don't have the bandwidth. 
>  Are you a developer interested in building on atproto? 
>  Bluesky is an open social network built on the AT Protocol, a flexible technology that will never lock developers out of the ecosystems that they help build. With atproto, third-party can be as seamless as first-party through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and more.

>  How to use 
>  I want to see what it looks like 
>  A Swagger UI instance prepopulated with the current version of the OpenAPI types is available to preview .
> You can create a session (use an app password!), input your authentication token
> and experiment with authenticated queries.

> while this project is still young! 
>  
>  This file is regenerated every two hours
>  via a GitHub Action to keep it up to date with
> the latest changes to the AT Protocol. It sources the

>  I want to generate code 
>  You'll need to use the OpenAPI generator of your choice. I've had luck with
>  openapi-typescript ! 
>  I want to generate the types locally 
>  You'll need to checkout this repository and
>  make sure Deno is installed .
> You'll also need to checkout a copy of the
>  bluesky-social/atproto repository
>  into this repo's directory. (Maybe one day I'll get fancy and set up
> submodules... but not today.) 
>  Then, run the following command: 
>  If you'd like to tweak the generator and see your changes live you can run the
> following command. It will watch for changes and re-run the script any time a
> file is updated: 
>  Known limitations 
>  It's currently not possible to represent the subscription type in OpenAPI. It
> appears the maintainers of the specification
>  have passed on the inclusion of any interfaces that are not strictly scoped to the HTTP protocol .
> (WebSockets are opened via a HTTP request, but I digress.)

> ozone 
>  Overview 
>  The Ozone project for the AT Protocol consists of 3 components: 
>  
>  A Gradle plugin to compile AT Protocol schemas into usable Kotlin classes. 
>  Multiplatform APIs for the AT Protocol spec that can be used with any compatible service, including Bluesky Social .
>  
>  Supports Android, JVM, JavaScript, and iOS. 
>  
>  
>  Example client apps that demonstrate usage of those APIs. 
>  
>  
>  Warning 
>  🚧 🚧 🚧 Everything in here is very much a work-in-progress!
> The upstream schemas are still subject to breaking
> changes and may break at any moment if used in production code. Use at your own risk! 
>  
>  Why "Ozone"? 
>  O 3 exists at all levels in the ATmosphere . 
>  No relation to the moderation tools also named Ozone . 
>  Bluesky Social Bindings 
>  Documentation is available at ozone.christian.sh . 
>  Java / Kotlin

>  In Xcode, select File &gt; Add Packages and enter https://github.com/christiandeange/BlueskyAPI 
>  Gradle Plugin 
>  In addition to shipping the lexicons that define the official Bluesky API, this project also includes a Gradle Plugin that allows you to bring your own lexicon definitions and generate any set of AT Protocol bindings from them.

>  Introduction 
>  This SDK attempts to implement everything that provides ATProto. There is support for Lexicon Schemes, XRPC clients, Firehose, Identity, DID keys, signatures, and more. All models, queries, and procedures are generated automatically. The main focus is on the lexicons of atproto.com and bsky.app, but it doesn't have a vendor lock on it. Feel free to use the code generator for your own lexicon schemes. SDK also provides utilities to work with CID, NSID, AT URI Schemes, DAG-CBOR, CAR files, DID Documents and more. 
>  Requirements 
>  
>  Python 3.8 or higher. 
>  
>  Installing 
>  Quick start 
>  First of all, you need to create the instance of the XRPC Client. To do so, you have two major options: asynchronous, and synchronous. The difference only in import and how you call the methods. If you are not familiar with async, use sync instead. 
>  For sync: 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  client = Client ()
>  # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor 
>  # Client('https://example.com') 
>  For async: 
>  from atproto import AsyncClient 
>  client = AsyncClient ()
>  # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor 
>  # AsyncClient('https://example.com') 
>  In the snippets below, only the sync version will be presented. 
>  Right after the creation of the Client instance, you probably want to access the full API and perform actions by profile. To achieve this, you should log in to the network using your handle and password. The password could be app-specific. 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' ) 
>  You are awesome! Now you feel to pick any high-level method that you want and perform it! 
>  Code to send post: 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  client . send_post ( text = 'Hello World!' )

>  Advanced usage 
>  I'll be honest. The high-level Client that was shown in the "Quick Start" section is not a real ATProto API. This is syntax sugar built upon the real XRPC methods! The high-level methods are not cover the full need of developers. To be able to do anything that you want, you should know to work with low-level API. Let's dive into it! 
>  The basics: 
>  
>  Namespaces – classes that group sub-namespaces and the XRPC queries and procedures. Built upon NSID ATProto semantic. 
>  Model – dataclasses for input, output, and params of the methods from namespaces. Models describe Record and all other types in the Lexicon Schemes. 
>  
>  Namespaces 
>  The client contains references to the root of all namespaces. It's com and app for now. 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  Client (). com 
>  Client (). app 
>  To dive deeper, you can navigate using hints from your IDE. Thanks to well-type hinted SDK, it's much easier. 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  Client (). com . atproto . server . create_session (...)
>  Client (). com . atproto . sync . get_blob (...)
>  Client (). app . bsky . feed . get_likes (...)
>  Client (). app . bsky . graph . get_follows (...) 
>  The endpoint of the path is always the method that you want to call. The method presents a query or procedure in XRPC. You should not care about it much. The only thing you need to know is that the procedures required data objects. Queries could be called with or without params. 
>  Records 
>  In some sub-namespaces, you can find records. Such record classes provide a syntax sugar not defined in the lexicon scheme. This sugar provides a more convenient way to work with repository operations. Such as creating a record, deleting a record, and so on. 
>  Here are some available records of Bluesky records: 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  Client (). app . bsky . feed . post 
>  Client (). app . bsky . feed . like 
>  Client (). app . bsky . graph . follow 
>  Client (). app . bsky . graph . block 
>  Client (). app . bsky . actor . profile 
>  # ... more 
>  Usage example with the post record: 
>  from atproto import AtUri , Client , models 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  posts = client . app . bsky . feed . post . list ( client . me . did , limit = 10 )
>  for uri , post in posts . records . items ():
>  print ( uri , post . text )
>  post = client . app . bsky . feed . post . get ( client . me . did , AtUri . from_str ( uri ). rkey )
>  print ( post . value . text )
>  post_record = models . AppBskyFeedPost . Record ( text = 'test record namespaces' , created_at = client . get_current_time_iso ())
>  new_post = client . app . bsky . feed . post . create ( client . me . did , post_record )
>  print ( new_post )
>  deleted_post = client . app . bsky . feed . post . delete ( client . me . did , AtUri . from_str ( new_post . uri ). rkey )
>  print ( deleted_post ) 
>  Please note that not all repository operations are covered by these syntax sugars. You can always use the low-level methods to perform any desired action. One such action is updating a record. 
>  Models 
>  To deal with methods, we need to deal with models! Models are available in the models module and have NSID-based aliases. Let's take a look at it. 
>  from atproto import models 
>  models . ComAtprotoIdentityResolveHandle 
>  models . AppBskyFeedPost 
>  models . AppBskyActorGetProfile 
>  # 90+ more... 
>  The model classes in the "models" aliases could be: 
>  
>  Data model 
>  Params model 
>  Response model 
>  Sugar response model 
>  Record model 
>  Type model 
>  
>  The only thing you need to know is how to create instances of models. Not with all models, you will work as model-creator. For example, SDK will create Response models for you. 
>  There are a few ways how to create the instance of a model: 
>  
>  Dict-based 
>  Class-based 
>  
>  The instances of data and params models should be passed as arguments to the methods that were described above. 
>  Dict-based: 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  # The params model will be created automatically internally for you! 
>  print ( client . com . atproto . identity . resolve_handle ({ 'handle' : 'marshal.dev' })) 
>  Class-based: 
>  from atproto import Client , models 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  params = models . ComAtprotoIdentityResolveHandle . Params ( handle = 'marshal.dev' )
>  print ( client . com . atproto . identity . resolve_handle ( params )) 
>  Tip: look at typehint of the method to figure out the name and the path to the input/data model! 
>  Pro Tip: use IDE autocompletion to find necessary models! Just start typing the method name right after the dot ( models.{type method name in camel case ). 
>  Models could be nested as hell. Be ready for it! 
>  This is how we can send a post with the image using low-level XRPC Client: 
>  from atproto import Client , models 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  with open ( 'cat.jpg' , 'rb' ) as f :
>  img_data = f . read ()
>  upload = client . upload_blob ( img_data )
>  images = [ models . AppBskyEmbedImages . Image ( alt = 'Img alt' , image = upload . blob )]
>  embed = models . AppBskyEmbedImages . Main ( images = images )
>  client . com . atproto . repo . create_record (
>  models . ComAtprotoRepoCreateRecord . Data (
>  repo = client . me . did ,
>  collection = models . ids . AppBskyFeedPost ,
>  record = models . AppBskyFeedPost . Record (
>  created_at = client . get_current_time_iso (), text = 'Text of the post' , embed = embed 
> ),
> )
> )
>  # of course, you can use the syntax sugar here instead 
>  post = models . AppBskyFeedPost . Record ( text = 'Text of the post' , embed = embed , created_at = client . get_current_time_iso ())
>  client . app . bsky . feed . post . create ( client . me . did , post )
>  # or even high-level client 
>  client . send_image ( text = 'Text of the post' , image = img_data , image_alt = 'Img alt' )
>  # these three methods are equivalent 
>  I hope you are not scared. May the Force be with you. Good luck!

> AT Protocol Bluesky NextJS 13.4 Client 
>  This is a proof of concept NextJS client for AT Protocol / Bluesky that works with NextJS 13.4's App Router and React Server Components for server-side rendering. 
>  Start 
>  # Install the packages 
> npm i
>  # Start the dev server 
> npm run dev
>  # Open in browser: http://localhost:3000 
>  Auth Middleware 
>  The middleware handles automatic redirection of logged in and logged out users to the appropriate pages during server-request. 
>  The primary middleware function hasActiveAtpSessionMiddleware() which checks for a session cookie and gets the session from the AT Protocol server uses the fetch() function for server-side compatibility. 
>  The fetch function is used instead of the XRPC wrapper. See below for reasons. 
>  Cookies 
>  
>  Cookies are used to allow server-side functions to access the client's auth session tokens 
>  
>  Data Fetching 
>  The built-in @atproto/api package instantiates a BskyAgent for convenient access to Bluesky queries and procedures. 
>  Example: await bskyAgent.getTimeline() 
>  However, these methods do not appear to be compatible with NextJS server-side rendering and data fetching and will result in the following error 
>  ReferenceError: document is not defined 
>  In the cases of server-side data fetching, the XRPC wrapper is bypassed and we call the endpoint URL directly with the fetch() function. 
>  Areas for Continued Development / Left Off 
>  I have not spent much time troubleshooting the document is not defined errors when trying to execute BskyAgent calls on the server. 
>  The defaultFetchHandler() function at the root of the XRPC calls appears to use the fetch() method which should be server-side compatible. 
>  Possible Solutions 
>  
>  It's possible this is a simple packaging issue or a bug in my code pattern 
>  It's possible that the code-generator could be modified to generate NextJS server-side compatible agent functions for each of the lexicon defined endpoints

> Ideas for Reddit on ATProto (v2) 
>  This repo contains lexicon schemas and some documentation on how a Reddit-like social network could be built on top of ATProto. 
>  The schema examples use the red.solver.board namespace, that's temporary. 
>  All schemas are in the lexicons/ directory of this repo. 
>  Open Issues 
>  
>  Members can't delete votes, submissions, comments or leave a board if the board decides to not cooperate 
>  
>  Board 
>  Subreddits are called boards. Every board needs a DID and ATProto repo. 
>  All records relevant to a board (profile, member, submission, vote, comment) are stored in the board DID's repository, most of them are signed by the DID of the user doing the operation too (member, submission, vote, comment). 
>  Every board is running a service to provide all relevant APIs for users. 
>  Board Profile 
>  Boards can have a short displayName , a short summary and a long description with detailed info and rules for that specific board. Boards can also have an avatar and a banner image, just like profiles. 
>  
>  [TODO: update section with better solution]
> Viewing submissions in a board is handled by feed generators. The board record has a feeds array which references one or multiple app.bsky.feed.generator records. The first one is the default one shown when viewing a new board for the first time. These feed generators can provide well-known views like "Hot", "New", "Rising", "Top (with time range)" and "Controversial", but also completely new and interesting algorithms. 
>  
>  Member 
>  A member record indicates that a user is a member of a board. To leave a board, the record is deleted. Member records can contain an optional role field to set permissions for a user. moderator is needed to hide or delete submissions and ban members, the admin permission is required to add new moderators and update the board itself. All moderation actions should be transparent and records too, this is not specced yet. 
>  Member records live in the board's repo, but MUST be signed by the member's DID too. They MUST include both the member DID and board DID to prevent other boards from re-using signed records to prove that someone is a member of a different board. 
>  Submission 
>  Users can submit submissions to boards if they are a member. Submissions do NOT contain text, images or other media directly. Instead, they reference another subject , which could be a Bluesky post or a record from another new lexicon, for example video. This architecture makes it possible to submit the same record to multiple boards without duplicating the content itself. It's also pretty powerful, because it could make anything from videos, podcasts to 3D models or books possible to be referenced and submitted without the board lexicon needing to be extended. 
>  In addition to the subject, submissions specify a createdAt timestamp. 
>  Submission records live in the board repo, but MUST be signed by the submitters's DID too. The record MUST contain the board DID and author DID. 
>  Upvotes and downvotes 
>  Upvotes and downvotes work exactly like app.bsky likes, they just have a different name and reference submissions instead of posts or feed generators. Only members of a board can upvote and downvote submissions in it, invalid votes are just ignored by aggregators. 
>  Comment 
>  A comment is a text-only comment on a submission or another comment. The text field supports Markdown formatting and has a max size of 10000 bytes or graphemes. root always references the root submission, parent is optional and references the parent comment.

>  Identity 
>  Your DID, or Decentralized Identifier, is your universal ID across atproto. You can change your handle, but your DID remains the same. You can read more on DIDs here . 
>  If you have a user's handle and you need to resolve it to their DID, you can use the com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle lexicon: 
>  handle = "foobar.bsky.social" # Input your handle here 
>  resolved_handle = requests . get (
>  "https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle" ,
>  params = { "handle" : handle }
> ). json ()
>  pp . pprint ( resolved_handle ) 
>  {'did': 'did:plc:yjmf4d5se4m23vgs7h5lyfgf'}
>  
>  
> The HTTP API endpoint above used the atproto lexicon com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle Lexicon is a schema system used to define RPC methods and record types. We'll use lexicons for the rest of this tutorial; you can read more about Lexicon here and see the HTTP API reference for all atproto and Bluesky lexicons here .

>  Data repository 
>  A user's data is stored in their signed data repository (repo). Their repo holds the collections of all of their records, which include posts, comments, likes, follows, media blobs, etc. All currently active records are stored in the repository, and current repository contents are publicly available. 
>  To access any user's data repository, you can use the com.atproto.repo.describeRepo lexicon:

>  Records 
>  The records in your data repository correspond exclusively to your "outbound" actions. For example, if you follow Paul or like one of Paul's posts, those records will be included in your data repository. However, if Paul were to follow you, there would be no record of that in your data repository; only Paul's. 
>  
> The records in your data repository alone can answer the question "who do you follow?" because all of your follow records exist in your data repository. However, in order to answer the question "who follows you?" we would need to check every single user's repo across the entire network and see who has a follow record pointing to your DID. This is also known as having a "global view" of the network, and we'll cover how that works in a bit.
>  
>  Posts, along with all other types of records, are identified using their uri and cid . 
>  
>  The uri can be thought of the path to that record, using the following format: at://[did]/[record-type]/[record-key] . 
>  The cid is the record's commit hash value and is used to cryptographically validate the record. 
>  
>  See an in-depth explanation of post records here 
>  The collections array in a user's data repo indicates all of the record types that that user has created. To retrieve all of a user's records of a given type, like all of their posts or all of their follows, you can use the com.atproto.repo.listRecords lexicon.

>  Authentication 
>  Most of the data on the protocol is publicly available. However, to access data within the App View (as well as any of your own private data, like mutes) you must authenticate with your regular Bluesky credentials. You can protect your credentials by creating an App Password for your project. 
>  Create a session 
>  Once you authenticate, you receive a session object. This object includes your accessJwt , which is used to authenticate requests and is valid for 2 hours. Your refreshJwt lasts longer and is used only to update the session with a new access token. The session object also includes some basic account information, like your did , handle , and email .

>  pp . pprint ( session ) 
>  
>  App View 
>  As mentioned, data repositories only include a user's "outbound" actions. In order to have a global view, like "which users liked this post?", an App View aggregates records across all data repositories on the network. 
>  The app.bsky.* endpoints pull information from the global App View:

> **TypeScript Services:**
> 
> * `pds`: "Personal Data Server", hosting repo content for atproto accounts. Most implementation code in `packages/pds`, with runtime wrapper in `services/pds`. See [bluesky-social/pds](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds) for directions on self-hosting.
> * `bsky`: AppView implementation of the `app.bsky.*` API endpoints. Running on main network at `api.bsky.app`. Most implementation code in `packages/bsky`, with runtime wrapper in `services/bsky`.
> 
> **Lexicons:** for both the `com.atproto.*` and `app.bsky.*` are canonically versioned in this repo, for now, under `./lexicons/`. These are JSON files in the [Lexicon schema definition language](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon), similar to JSON Schema or OpenAPI.
> 
> **Interoperability Test Data:** the language-neutral test files in `./interop-test-files/` may be useful for other protocol implementations to ensure that they follow the specification correctly
> 
> The source code for the Bluesky Social client app (for web and mobile) can be found at [bluesky-social/social-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app).
> 
> Go programming language source code is in [bluesky-social/indigo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo), including the BGS implementation.
> 
> ## Developer Quickstart
> 
> [](#developer-quickstart)
> 
> We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node.js installs. This project requires Node.js version 18\. `pnpm` is used to manage the workspace of multiple packages. You can install it with `npm install --global pnpm`.
> 
> There is a Makefile which can help with basic development tasks:
> 
> # use existing nvm to install node 18 and pnpm
> make nvm-setup
> 
> # pull dependencies and build all local packages
> make deps
> make build
> 
> # run the tests, using Docker services as needed
> make test
> 
> # run a local PDS and AppView with fake test accounts and data
> # (this requires a global installation of `jq` and `docker`)
> make run-dev-env
> 
> # show all other commands
> make help

> ## ATP API
> 
> [](#atp-api)
> 
> This API is a client for ATProtocol servers. It communicates using HTTP. It includes:
> 
> * ✔️ APIs for ATProto and Bluesky.
> * ✔️ Validation and complete typescript types.
> * ✔️ Session management.
> * ✔️ A RichText library.
> 
> ## Getting started
> 
> [](#getting-started)
> 
> First install the package:
> 
> Then in your application:
> 
> import { AtpAgent } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> const agent = new AtpAgent({ service: 'https://example.com' })
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> [](#usage)
> 
> ### Session management
> 
> [](#session-management)
> 
> You'll need an authenticated session for most API calls. There are two ways to manage sessions:
> 
> 1. [App password based session management](#app-password-based-session-management)
> 2. [OAuth based session management](#oauth-based-session-management)
> 
> #### App password based session management
> 
> [](#app-password-based-session-management)
> 
> Username / password based authentication can be performed using the `AtpAgent`class.
> 
> Caution
> 
> This method is deprecated in favor of OAuth based session management. It is recommended to use OAuth based session management (through the`@atproto/oauth-client-*` packages).
> 
> import { AtpAgent, AtpSessionEvent, AtpSessionData } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> // configure connection to the server, without account authentication
> const agent = new AtpAgent({
>   service: 'https://example.com',
>   persistSession: (evt: AtpSessionEvent, sess?: AtpSessionData) => {
>     // store the session-data for reuse
>   },
> })
> 
> // Change the agent state to an authenticated state either by:
> 
> // 1) creating a new account on the server.
> await agent.createAccount({
>   email: 'alice@mail.com',
>   password: 'hunter2',
>   handle: 'alice.example.com',
>   inviteCode: 'some-code-12345-abcde',
> })
> 
> // 2) if an existing session was securely stored previously, then reuse that to resume the session.
> await agent.resumeSession(savedSessionData)
> 
> // 3) if no old session was available, create a new one by logging in with password (App Password)
> await agent.login({
>   identifier: 'alice@mail.com',
>   password: 'hunter2',
> })
> 
> #### OAuth based session management
> 
> [](#oauth-based-session-management)
> 
> Depending on the environment used by your application, different OAuth clients are available:
> 
> * [@atproto/oauth-client-browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client-browser): for the browser.
> * [@atproto/oauth-client-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client-node): for Node.js.
> * [@atproto/oauth-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client): Lower level; compatible with most JS engines.
> 
> Every `@atproto/oauth-client-*` implementation has a different way to obtain an`OAuthSession` instance that can be used to instantiate an `Agent` (from`@atproto/api`). Here is an example restoring a previously saved session:
> 
> import { Agent } from '@atproto/api'
> import { OAuthClient } from '@atproto/oauth-client'
> 
> const oauthClient = new OAuthClient({
>   // ...
> })
> 
> const oauthSession = await oauthClient.restore('did:plc:123')
> 
> // Instantiate the api Agent using an OAuthSession
> const agent = new Agent(oauthSession)
> 
> ### API calls
> 
> [](#api-calls)
> 
> The agent includes methods for many common operations, including:
> 
> // The DID of the user currently authenticated (or undefined)
> agent.did
> agent.accountDid // Throws if the user is not authenticated
> 
> // Feeds and content
> await agent.getTimeline(params, opts)
> await agent.getAuthorFeed(params, opts)
> await agent.getPostThread(params, opts)
> await agent.getPost(params)
> await agent.getPosts(params, opts)
> await agent.getLikes(params, opts)
> await agent.getRepostedBy(params, opts)
> await agent.post(record)
> await agent.deletePost(postUri)
> await agent.like(uri, cid)
> await agent.deleteLike(likeUri)
> await agent.repost(uri, cid)
> await agent.deleteRepost(repostUri)
> await agent.uploadBlob(data, opts)
> 
> // Social graph
> await agent.getFollows(params, opts)
> await agent.getFollowers(params, opts)
> await agent.follow(did)
> await agent.deleteFollow(followUri)
> 
> // Actors
> await agent.getProfile(params, opts)
> await agent.upsertProfile(updateFn)
> await agent.getProfiles(params, opts)
> await agent.getSuggestions(params, opts)
> await agent.searchActors(params, opts)
> await agent.searchActorsTypeahead(params, opts)
> await agent.mute(did)
> await agent.unmute(did)
> await agent.muteModList(listUri)
> await agent.unmuteModList(listUri)
> await agent.blockModList(listUri)
> await agent.unblockModList(listUri)
> 
> // Notifications
> await agent.listNotifications(params, opts)
> await agent.countUnreadNotifications(params, opts)
> await agent.updateSeenNotifications()
> 
> // Identity
> await agent.resolveHandle(params, opts)
> await agent.updateHandle(params, opts)
> 
> // Legacy: Session management should be performed through the SessionManager
> // rather than the Agent instance.
> if (agent instanceof AtpAgent) {
>   // AtpAgent instances support using different sessions during their lifetime
>   await agent.createAccount({ ... }) // session a
>   await agent.login({ ... }) // session b
>   await agent.resumeSession(savedSession) // session c
> }
> 
> ### Validation and types
> 
> [](#validation-and-types)
> 
> The package includes a complete types system which includes validation and type-guards. For example, to validate a post record:
> 
> import { AppBskyFeedPost } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> const post = {...}
> if (AppBskyFeedPost.isRecord(post)) {
>   // typescript now recognizes `post` as a AppBskyFeedPost.Record
>   // however -- we still need to validate it
>   const res = AppBskyFeedPost.validateRecord(post)
>   if (res.success) {
>     // a valid record
>   } else {
>     // something is wrong
>     console.log(res.error)
>   }
> }
> 
> ### Rich text
> 
> [](#rich-text)
> 
> Some records (ie posts) use the `app.bsky.richtext` lexicon. At the moment richtext is only used for links and mentions, but it will be extended over time to include bold, italic, and so on.
> 
> ℹ️ It is **strongly** recommended to use this package's `RichText` library. Javascript encodes strings in utf16 while the protocol (and most other programming environments) use utf8\. Converting between the two is challenging, but `RichText` handles that for you.
> 
> import { RichText } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> // creating richtext
> const rt = new RichText({
>   text: 'Hello @alice.com, check out this link: https://example.com',
> })
> await rt.detectFacets(agent) // automatically detects mentions and links
> const postRecord = {
>   $type: 'app.bsky.feed.post',
>   text: rt.text,
>   facets: rt.facets,
>   createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
> }
> 
> // rendering as markdown
> let markdown = ''
> for (const segment of rt.segments()) {
>   if (segment.isLink()) {
>     markdown += `[${segment.text}](${segment.link?.uri})`
>   } else if (segment.isMention()) {
>     markdown += `[${segment.text}](https://my-bsky-app.com/user/${segment.mention?.did})`
>   } else {
>     markdown += segment.text
>   }
> }
> 
> // calculating string lengths
> const rt2 = new RichText({ text: 'Hello' })
> console.log(rt2.length) // => 5
> console.log(rt2.graphemeLength) // => 5
> const rt3 = new RichText({ text: '👨‍👩‍👧‍👧' })
> console.log(rt3.length) // => 25

> ### Moderation
> 
> [](#moderation)
> 
> Applying the moderation system is a challenging task, but we've done our best to simplify it for you. The Moderation API helps handle a wide range of tasks, including:
> 
> * Moderator labeling
> * User muting (including mutelists)
> * User blocking
> * Mutewords
> * Hidden posts
> 
> For more information, see the [Moderation Documentation](/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/packages/api/docs/moderation.md).

> 
> The AT Protocol identifies methods and records with reverse-DNS names. You can use them on the agent as well:

>   },
> })
> const res2 = await agent.com.atproto.repo.listRecords({
>   repo: alice.did,
>   collection: 'app.bsky.feed.post',
> })
> 
> const res3 = await agent.app.bsky.feed.post.create(
>   { repo: alice.did },
>   {
>     text: 'Hello, world!',
>     createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
>   },
> )
> const res4 = await agent.app.bsky.feed.post.list({ repo: alice.did })
> 
> ### Non-browser configuration
> 
> [](#non-browser-configuration)
> 
> If your environment doesn't have a built-in `fetch` implementation, you'll need to provide one. This will typically be done through a polyfill.
> 
> ### Bring your own fetch
> 
> [](#bring-your-own-fetch)
> 
> If you want to provide your own `fetch` implementation, you can do so by instantiating the sessionManager with a custom fetch implementation:
> 
> import { AtpAgent } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> const myFetch = (input: RequestInfo | URL, init?: RequestInit) => {
>   console.log('requesting', input)
>   const response = await globalThis.fetch(input, init)

> ### Introduction
> 
> [](#introduction)
> 
> This SDK attempts to implement everything that provides ATProto. There is support for Lexicon Schemes, XRPC clients, Firehose, Identity, DID keys, signatures, and more. All models, queries, and procedures are generated automatically. The main focus is on the lexicons of atproto.com and bsky.app, but it doesn't have a vendor lock on it. Feel free to use the code generator for your own lexicon schemes. The SDK also provides utilities to work with CID, NSID, AT URI Schemes, DAG-CBOR, CAR files, DID Documents and more.
> 
> ### Requirements
> 
> [](#requirements)
> 
> * Python 3.8 or higher.
> 
> ### Installing
> 
> [](#installing)
> 
> ### Quick start
> 
> [](#quick-start)
> 
> First of all, you need to create the instance of the XRPC Client. To do so, you have two major options: asynchronous and synchronous. The difference is only in the import and how you call the methods. If you are not familiar with async, use sync instead.
> 
> For sync:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor
> # Client('https://example.com')
> 
> For async:
> 
> from atproto import AsyncClient
> 
> client = AsyncClient()
> # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor
> # AsyncClient('https://example.com')
> 
> In the snippets below, only the sync version will be presented.
> 
> Right after the creation of the Client instance, you will probably want to access the full API and perform actions by profile. To achieve this, you should log into the network using your handle and password. The password could be app-specific.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> 
> You are awesome! Now feel free to pick any high-level method that you want and try it out!
> 
> Code to send a post:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> client.send_post(text='Hello World!')
> 
> Useful links to continue:

> [](#documentation)
> 
> The documentation is live at [atproto.blue](https://atproto.blue/).
> 
> ### Getting help
> 
> [](#getting-help)
> 
> You can get help in several ways:
> 
> * Report bugs, request new features by [creating an issue](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/issues/new).
> * Ask questions by [starting a discussion](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/discussions/new).
> * Ask questions in [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PCyVJXU9jN).
> 
> ### Advanced usage
> 
> [](#advanced-usage)
> 
> I'll be honest. The high-level Client that was shown in the "Quick Start" section is not a real ATProto API. This is syntax sugar built upon the real XRPC methods! The high-level methods do not cover the full needs of developers. To be able to do anything that you want, you should know how to work with low-level API. Let's dive into it!
> 
> The basics:
> 
> * Namespaces – classes that group sub-namespaces and the XRPC queries and procedures. Built upon NSID ATProto semantic.
> * Model – dataclasses for input, output, and params of the methods from namespaces. Models describe Record and all other types in the Lexicon Schemes.
> 
> #### Namespaces
> 
> [](#namespaces)
> 
> The client contains references to the root of all namespaces. It's `com` and `app` for now.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().com
> Client().app
> 
> To dive deeper, you can navigate using hints from your IDE. Thanks to a well-type hinted SDK, it's much easier.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().com.atproto.server.create_session(...)
> Client().com.atproto.sync.get_blob(...)
> Client().app.bsky.feed.get_likes(...)
> Client().app.bsky.graph.get_follows(...)
> 
> The endpoint of the path is always the method you want to call. The method presents a query or procedure in XRPC. You should not care about it much. The only thing you need to know is that the procedures require data objects. Queries could be called with or without params.
> 
> #### Records
> 
> [](#records)
> 
> In some sub-namespaces, you can find records. Such record classes provide a syntax sugar not defined in the lexicon scheme. This sugar provides a more convenient way to work with repository operations, such as creating a record, deleting a record, and so on.
> 
> Here are some available records of Bluesky records:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().app.bsky.feed.post
> Client().app.bsky.feed.like
> Client().app.bsky.graph.follow
> Client().app.bsky.graph.block
> Client().app.bsky.actor.profile
> # ... more
> 
> Usage example with the `post` record:
> 
> from atproto import AtUri, Client, models
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> 
> posts = client.app.bsky.feed.post.list(client.me.did, limit=10)
> for uri, post in posts.records.items():
>     print(uri, post.text)
> 
> post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.get(client.me.did, AtUri.from_str(uri).rkey)
> print(post.value.text)
> 
> post_record = models.AppBskyFeedPost.Record(text='test record namespaces', created_at=client.get_current_time_iso())
> new_post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.create(client.me.did, post_record)
> print(new_post)
> 
> deleted_post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.delete(client.me.did, AtUri.from_str(new_post.uri).rkey)
> print(deleted_post)
>

> ### Introduction[¶](#introduction "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> This SDK attempts to implement everything that provides ATProto. There is support for Lexicon Schemes, XRPC clients, Firehose, Identity, DID keys, signatures, and more. All models, queries, and procedures are generated automatically. The main focus is on the lexicons of atproto.com and bsky.app, but it doesn’t have a vendor lock on it. Feel free to use the code generator for your own lexicon schemes. The SDK also provides utilities to work with CID, NSID, AT URI Schemes, DAG-CBOR, CAR files, DID Documents and more.
> 
> ### Requirements[¶](#requirements "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> * Python 3.8 or higher.
> 
> ### Installing[¶](#installing "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> ### Quick start[¶](#quick-start "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> First of all, you need to create the instance of the XRPC Client. To do so, you have two major options: asynchronous and synchronous. The difference is only in the import and how you call the methods. If you are not familiar with async, use sync instead.
> 
> For sync:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor
> # Client('https://example.com')
> 
> For async:
> 
> from atproto import AsyncClient
> 
> client = AsyncClient()
> # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor
> # AsyncClient('https://example.com')
> 
> In the snippets below, only the sync version will be presented.
> 
> Right after the creation of the Client instance, you will probably want to access the full API and perform actions by profile. To achieve this, you should log into the network using your handle and password. The password could be app-specific.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> 
> You are awesome! Now feel free to pick any high-level method that you want and try it out!
> 
> Code to send a post:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> client.send_post(text='Hello World!')
> 
> Useful links to continue:
> 
> * [List of all methods with documentation](https://atproto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/atproto%5Fclient/index.html).
> * [Examples of using the methods](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/tree/main/examples).

> ### SDK structure[¶](#sdk-structure "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> The SDK is built upon the following components:
> 
> | Package           | Description                                                                 |
> | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | atproto           | Import shortcuts to other packages.                                         |
> | atproto\_cli      | CLI tool to generate code.                                                  |
> | atproto\_client   | XRPC Client, data models, and utils like rich text helper.                  |
> | atproto\_codegen  | Code generator of models, clients, and namespaces.                          |
> | atproto\_core     | Tools to work with NSID, AT URI Schemes, CID, CAR files, and DID Documents. |
> | atproto\_crypto   | Crypto utils like multibase, signature verification, work with DID keys.    |
> | atproto\_firehose | Firehose (data streaming) client and models.                                |
> | atproto\_identity | Identity resolvers for DID, Handle, AT Protocol data, signing keys.         |
> | atproto\_lexicon  | Lexicon parser.                                                             |
> | atproto\_server   | Server-side utils like JWT.                                                 |
> 
> I highly recommend that you use the `atproto` package to import everything that you need. It contains shortcuts to all other packages.

> ### Documentation[¶](#documentation "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> The documentation is live at [atproto.blue](https://atproto.blue/).
> 
> ### Getting help[¶](#getting-help "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> You can get help in several ways:
> 
> * Report bugs, request new features by [creating an issue](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/issues/new).
> * Ask questions by [starting a discussion](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/discussions/new).
> * Ask questions in [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PCyVJXU9jN).
> 
> ### Advanced usage[¶](#advanced-usage "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> I’ll be honest. The high-level Client that was shown in the “Quick Start” section is not a real ATProto API. This is syntax sugar built upon the real XRPC methods! The high-level methods do not cover the full needs of developers. To be able to do anything that you want, you should know how to work with low-level API. Let’s dive into it!
> 
> The basics:
> 
> * Namespaces – classes that group sub-namespaces and the XRPC queries and procedures. Built upon NSID ATProto semantic.
> * Model – dataclasses for input, output, and params of the methods from namespaces. Models describe Record and all other types in the Lexicon Schemes.
> 
> #### Namespaces[¶](#namespaces "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> The client contains references to the root of all namespaces. It’s `com` and `app` for now.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().com
> Client().app
> 
> To dive deeper, you can navigate using hints from your IDE. Thanks to a well-type hinted SDK, it’s much easier.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().com.atproto.server.create_session(...)
> Client().com.atproto.sync.get_blob(...)
> Client().app.bsky.feed.get_likes(...)
> Client().app.bsky.graph.get_follows(...)
> 
> The endpoint of the path is always the method you want to call. The method presents a query or procedure in XRPC. You should not care about it much. The only thing you need to know is that the procedures require data objects. Queries could be called with or without params.
> 
> #### Records[¶](#records "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> In some sub-namespaces, you can find records. Such record classes provide a syntax sugar not defined in the lexicon scheme. This sugar provides a more convenient way to work with repository operations, such as creating a record, deleting a record, and so on.
> 
> Here are some available records of Bluesky records:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().app.bsky.feed.post
> Client().app.bsky.feed.like
> Client().app.bsky.graph.follow
> Client().app.bsky.graph.block
> Client().app.bsky.actor.profile
> # ... more
> 
> Usage example with the `post` record:
> 
> from atproto import AtUri, Client, models
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> 
> posts = client.app.bsky.feed.post.list(client.me.did, limit=10)
> for uri, post in posts.records.items():
>     print(uri, post.text)
> 
> post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.get(client.me.did, AtUri.from_str(uri).rkey)
> print(post.value.text)
> 
> post_record = models.AppBskyFeedPost.Record(text='test record namespaces', created_at=client.get_current_time_iso())
> new_post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.create(client.me.did, post_record)
> print(new_post)
> 
> deleted_post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.delete(client.me.did, AtUri.from_str(new_post.uri).rkey)
> print(deleted_post)
>

> **This library is a Bluesky/ATProtocol client library compatible with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html).**It depends on [khttpclient](https://github.com/uakihir0/khttpclient) and uses Ktor Client internally. Therefore, this library can be used on any platform supported by Kotlin Multiplatform and Ktor Client. The behavior on each platform depends on [khttpclient](https://github.com/uakihir0/khttpclient).
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> [](#usage)
> 
> Below is how to use it with Kotlin on the supported platforms using Gradle.  
> **If you are using it on an Apple platform, please refer to [kbsky-cocoapods](https://github.com/uakihir0/kbsky-cocoapods).**  
> Additionally, please check the test code as well.

> > Java 21 LTS I want to build a Java implementation of Bluesky's ATProtocol. The goal is to build a package JAR file that anyone can use as a base to build a Java program from. I want to utilize the official Typescript imlementation as a reference to preferably port their code to Java, or to build my own version from.
> > Create a file tree of this project using the supplied Typescript implementation as an example. Maintain the naming conventions found in the Typescript code so long as they remain compatible with Java 21. Also keep in mind common ways on how Java libraries are structured. I do not want to use any additional libraries outside of the Java 21 SDK if at all possible (keep it as "pure Java" as possible). For any tests found in their repo, assume that I will be using JUnit in my project.
> > Present to me as complete of a file tree as possible for me to build from.
> 
> #### _Assistant_
> 
> > Okay, here's a proposed file tree structure for a Java-based AT Protocol library, mirroring the structure and concepts of the TypeScript reference implementation (`@atproto/api` specifically), while adhering to Java conventions and aiming for a "pure Java" approach (using only the Java 21 SDK where possible).

> > 1.  **TypeScript and Lexicons:** In the TypeScript reference implementation, the `@atproto/lexicon` package and the `./lexicons` directory serve a specific purpose:
> > 
> >     *   **`@atproto/lexicon` Package:** This package provides tools for *working with* Lexicon schemas. It includes utilities for parsing, validating, and compiling Lexicon files.
> >     *   **`./lexicons` Directory:** This directory contains the actual `.json` files that define the Lexicon schemas themselves (e.g., `app.bsky.feed.post.json`). These files are *data*, not code. TypeScript code then *uses* these Lexicon files (with the help of the `@atproto/lexicon` package) to generate types, validate data, etc.
> > 
> > 2.  **Java's Approach: Classes as Schemas:** In our Java implementation, we're taking a different, more idiomatic Java approach:
> > 
> >     *   **Java Classes as Schemas:** We are using Java classes (and specifically Java records where appropriate) to *directly* represent the data structures defined by the Lexicons. For example, instead of a separate `app.bsky.feed.post.json` file, we have a `Post.java` record in the `com.atproto.api.models.app.bsky.feed` package.
> >     *   **No Separate Lexicon Files:** We *don't* have separate `.json` files defining the schemas. The Java classes *themselves* serve as the schema definitions. This is a common and powerful approach in Java.
> >     * **Compile-Time Type Safety:** Instead of using types that must refer to a set of lexicon files, using classes means the compiler can check to see if the models are valid at compile-time.
> > 
> > 3.  **Implications for the `lexicon` Folder:**
> > 
> 
> ```
> 
> ```md
>  docs/chats/20250323T203205_session.md
> > *   **Package Structure:**  The Java convention is to use reverse domain name notation for packages (e.g., `com.atproto`).  This helps avoid naming conflicts.  I've mirrored the TypeScript structure within this, creating subpackages for `api`, `models`, `xrpc`, `identifiers`, etc.
> > *   **`AtpAgent`:** This is your primary entry point, analogous to `BskyAgent` in TypeScript.  It will handle session management (using `AtpSession`) and provide methods for the various AT Protocol API calls.
> > *   **`models` Package:**  Instead of Lexicon files, you'll define Java classes (likely using records in Java 21 for immutable data objects) to represent the data structures of the AT Protocol (e.g., `Post`, `GetTimelineResponse`).  This is *crucially* important for type safety and ease of use in Java.  Subpackages within `models` (like `com.atproto.repo`, `app.bsky.feed`) mirror the Lexicon namespaces.  The models are organized by the namespaces they belong too, following how it is layed out in atproto/api's README ([https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/packages/api/README.md](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/packages/api/README.md))
> > *   **`xrpc` Package:**  This contains the lower-level HTTP communication logic.  Java 21 has a built-in `HttpClient` (in `java.net.http`), which you should use.  `XrpcClient` would handle creating requests, sending them, and parsing responses.  `XrpcRequest` and `XrpcResponse` would encapsulate the request/response details. `XrpcException` would model any errors in comuncation.
> > *	**`Params` Interface:** XprcClient uses the Params interface to represent client query parameters.

> Kotlin Docs URL: https://github.com/uakihir0/kbsky 
> Java 21 LTS Maven Documentation I want to build a Java implementation of Bluesky's ATProtocol. The goal is to build a package JAR file that anyone can use as a base to build a Java program from. I want to utilize the official Typescript imlementation as a reference to preferably port their code to Java, or to build my own version from.
> Create a file tree of this project using the supplied Typescript, Go, Python, and Kotlin implementations as examples. Keep in mind that the Typescript implementation is the most complete and is tested completely working - the others only partially implement ATProtocol. Also keep in mind common ways on how Java libraries are structured. I do not want to use any additional libraries outside of the Java 21 SDK if at all possible (keep it as "pure Java" as possible). For any tests found in those repos, assume that I will be using JUnit in my project.
> Also assume that I will be creating a a code generator to pull/generate Lexicons (like the Typescript implementation does). This generator will need to be a part of this project.
> README.md   Present to me as complete of a file tree as possible for me to build from, using my current codebase as an example. Feel free to delete redundant or unnecessary Java files.

#### _Assistant_

> Okay, here's a revised and more complete file tree structure, taking into account the additional information, the existing implementations (Go, Python, Kotlin), the need for a Lexicon code generator, and best practices for a Java library.  I've also incorporated feedback from the previous iterations and added more detail where appropriate. I've also refined the structure based on your existing codebase and removed a few things that are unlikely to be necessary.

> Key Improvements and Explanations:
> 
> *   **`codegen` Package:**  This is *crucially* important.  It houses the Lexicon code generator, separated into:
>     *   `LexiconParser`:  Parses the JSON Lexicon files.  You can use the built in `java.util.spi.ToolProvider` to create a `jar` tool provider for the generator, which is built into Java.
>     *   `ModelGenerator`:  Generates Java record classes (for data models) based on the parsed Lexicon.
>     *   `ClientGenerator`: Generates the `com.atproto.api` methods based on the parsed Lexicon (similar to how the Python SDK does it).
>     *   `Generator`: Provides a main class to tie the generator all together.
> *   **`models` Package Structure:**  The `models` package now mirrors the Lexicon namespaces *exactly*, using nested packages (e.g., `com.atproto.repo`, `app.bsky.feed`). This is the standard way to organize data models in a Java project of this nature, and it provides excellent clarity and maintainability. You should include any inner classes in their respective files.
> *   **`common` Package:**  This package contains utilities that are *not* specific to XRPC or the Bluesky API but are used across the library. This includes `Nsid`, `Cid`, and `AtUri` classes.
> *   **`identity` Package:**  The `IdentityResolver` is now an *interface*.  You'll have separate `DidResolver` and `HandleResolver` classes that *implement* this interface.  This allows for different resolution strategies (e.g., you could have a caching resolver).
> *   **`crypto` Package:**  Place simplified cryptographic utilities here, relying on `java.security` as much as possible.
> *   **`test` Package:** The `test` package mirrors the `main` package structure, which is the standard practice in Java.  You'll have JUnit tests for each corresponding class (e.g., `AtpAgentTest` for `AtpAgent`).
> *   **`resources` Package (in `test`):** Put sample Lexicon JSON files here to use in your code generator tests. This ensures your parser and generators are working correctly.
> *   **`build.gradle.kts` (or `pom.xml`):** I strongly recommend using Gradle (with the Kotlin DSL, as shown) instead of Maven. Gradle has better support for modern Java features and multi-module projects. However, I've included `pom.xml` as an option if you *must* use Maven.
> * **`docs/chats/20250323T203205_session.md`:** This file has been moved inside the `docs/` folder to consolidate project-related documentation
> * **Typeguards Removed:** The previous iterations included a `typeguards` package which, after careful consideration of the other implementations (especially Python's), does not seem necessary. The other packages rely on code generation and do not require such a feature, since it is automatically handled by the models in most cases.
> 
> This structure gives you a solid foundation for a well-organized, maintainable, and idiomatic Java library for the AT Protocol.  The code generator is the most complex part, but it's essential for keeping your library in sync with the evolving Lexicon schemas.

> Describe the files AppBskyFeedDefs.java and AppBskyFeedPost.java. What are they supposed to do at a high level? Are they in the right place in the file tree? Should I create them right now, or do they need to be generated by the Lexicon generator?
> The files in the above tree appear to be located at src/main/java/com/atproto.

#### _Assistant_

> Let's break down `AppBskyFeedDefs.java` and `AppBskyFeedPost.java` and their roles within the project structure.
> 
> **`AppBskyFeedPost.java`**
> 
> *   **What it is:** This file, most likely represents the `app.bsky.feed.post` Lexicon schema. Based on the file tree, and your stated goals, it's almost certainly a Java *record* (though it could be a standard class if you're not using Java 16+).  It's a data model. It *should not* contain any methods related to performing network actions.
> *   **What it does:** It defines the structure of a Bluesky post. It will have fields like `text` (String), `createdAt` (probably `java.time.Instant`), `embed` (another model class representing embedded content), `entities` (for rich text; likely a List of a custom `Facet` class, as seen in the TypeScript `RichText` implementation), `langs` (List<String>), etc., corresponding directly to the fields defined in the `app.bsky.feed.post` Lexicon.
> *   **Right place?**  Almost. It should be in `src/main/java/com/atproto/models/app/bsky/feed/Post.java`. The presence of the `api` directory in your path is incorrect here. We're creating the *model*, NOT the api request (so we also should remove the current version in `src/main/java/com/atproto/api/models/...`).
> *   **Generated?**  *Yes*. This file should be generated by your `ModelGenerator` class within the `codegen` package.
> 
> **`AppBskyFeedDefs.java`**
> 
> *   **What it is:**  Based on the naming convention, and its location next to `AppBskyFeedPost.java` inside the `typeguards` folder, I initially believed this to be a "type guard" class, similar to those found in the TypeScript implementation. However, given that this is a Java implementation of the atproto protocol, and by using the Lexicon code generator to create distinct model classes, typeguards are not necessary.
> *   **What it does:** As discussed above, this file will most likely not be necessary to include in your codebase.
> *   **Right place?** No. This file should not exist in this location, or within your codebase.
> *   **Generated?** No. It's likely an unnecessary file given your `ModelGenerator`s role.
> 
> **Summary and Recommendations**
> 
> 1.  **Move and Rename `Post.java`:** Relocate `src/main/java/com/atproto/api/models/app/bsky/feed/Post.java` to the correct models/ directory: `src/main/java/com/atproto/models/app/bsky/feed/Post.java`.
> 
> 2.  **Delete** `src/main/java/com/atproto/api/typeguards/AppBskyFeedPost.java` and `src/main/java/com/atproto/api/typeguards/AppBsktFeedDefs.java`.
> 
> 3. **Delete** the `src/main/java/com/atproto/api/identifiers/` directory, moving `AtUri.java`, `Did.java`, and `Handle.java` into `src/main/java/com/atproto/common/`. `AtUri.java` has already been moved.
> 
> 4. **Ensure Code Generation:**  Make absolutely sure your `codegen/ModelGenerator.java` is designed to generate the `Post.java` (and all other model classes) *automatically* from the Lexicon definitions.  You *should not* be writing these model classes by hand.  This auto-generation is *the* core principle of how the TypeScript, Python, and Go implementations maintain consistency and handle schema changes. The model generator should output files into the `models/*` folders located at: `src/main/java/com/atproto/models/`.
> 
> 5.  **Test Resources:**  Your `src/test/resources/lexicons/com/example/test.json` is a great start.  You'll want to create sample `.json` files that represent *valid* Lexicon schemas.  Your `LexiconParserTest`, `ModelGeneratorTest`, and `ClientGeneratorTest` should use these files as inputs to ensure your code generator works correctly.
> 
> 6. **HttpUtil moved into xrpc folder:** The file src/main/java/com/atproto/api/xrpc/util/HttpUtil.java should exist as instead, src/main/java/com/atproto/api/xrpc/HttpUtil.java
> 
> In short, the most critical next step is to get your `codegen` package fully functional.  The `ModelGenerator` will be creating `Post.java`, and you shouldn't create it manually. The other files were unnecessary after clarifying their purpose.

> Key Changes and Rationale:
> 
> *   **`api/models` Removed:** The `models` subdirectory *within* `api` is gone.  Models are now *only* in the top-level `models` package, organized by their Lexicon namespace.  This is a critical correction for proper Java structure.
> 
> *   **`identifiers` Package Removed:**  `AtUri`, `Did`, and `Handle` are now directly in `common`, as they are general-purpose utilities, not specific identifiers.
> 
> *   **`typeguards` Package Removed:** Typeguards are a Typescript concept and not needed.
> 
> * **`api/xrpc/HttpUtil.java` location corrected.**
> 
> *   **`test/resources/lexicons`:**  This structure is now explicitly laid out to hold your test Lexicon files.  This keeps your test data separate from your main code.
> 
> * **`ModerationAction.java` Location Refined:** The context suggests that `ModerationAction` might have uses *outside* of just the API layer, which might apply moderation in other contexts. I've kept it in its own `moderation` package, parallel to the main `api` package, for this usage.
> 
> *  **Test Structure:** The `test` directory directly mirrors the new `main` directory layout, containing unit tests for the respective classes.
> 
> This revised file tree is significantly cleaner, adheres to standard Java conventions, and reflects the intended purpose of each component much more accurately. It emphasizes a clean separation of concerns: API interaction (`api`), core utilities (`common`), data models (`models`), cryptography (`crypto`), identity resolution (`identity`), moderation (`moderation`) and code generation (`codegen`).  It leverages Java's type system and package structure to organize the code logically. The file structure properly represents the suggested file paths.

> Rewrite that file tree again. This time, explicitly identify files that are going to be generated by the Lexicon generator. Output the full file tree.

#### _Assistant_

> Okay, here's the file tree, with explicit marking of files that should be generated by the Lexicon code generator. I'll use `**[GENERATED]**` to denote these files. I'll also make a few minor, but important organizational suggestions.  The suggestions maintain the spirit of the previous file tree, but clean up a couple of inconsistencies and improve overall structure.

> Key Changes and Justifications:
> 
> *   **`**[GENERATED]**` Marker:**  Clearly indicates which files are output by the code generator.
> *   **`models/` Package Contents:**  *All* files within the `models` package (and its subpackages) are now marked as `**[GENERATED]**`.  This is the most crucial point: your `ModelGenerator` is responsible for creating *all* the model classes based on the Lexicons.
> *    **`HttpUtil.java` Moved:** `HttpUtil.java` has been moved out of util and up one level to be within the `xrpc` package where it is primarily used.
> *   **`api/` Contents:** The `api/` package contains very few hand written files.
> *   **Test Structure:** The test structure mirrors the main structure
> *   **No `typeguards`:** The `typeguards` directory has been removed.
> * **Test Models:** The model test files no longer exists in the root models directory, but follow the folder struture of the generated model files.
> 
> This file tree is now extremely clear about which parts of your codebase are manually created versus automatically generated.  It also reflects a highly organized and maintainable structure for a Java library interacting with the AT Protocol.  The structure is consistent, follows best practices, and is ready for code generation. Remember to ensure your model tests reflect this updated structure.
