> AT Protocol Reference Implementation (TypeScript) 
>  Welcome friends! 
>  This repository contains Bluesky's reference implementation of AT Protocol, and of the app.bsky microblogging application service backend. 
>  What is in here? 
>  TypeScript Packages: 
>  TypeScript Services: 
>  
>  pds : "Personal Data Server", hosting repo content for atproto accounts. Most implementation code in packages/pds , with runtime wrapper in services/pds . See bluesky-social/pds for directions on self-hosting. 
>  bsky : AppView implementation of the app.bsky.* API endpoints. Running on main network at api.bsky.app . Most implementation code in packages/bsky , with runtime wrapper in services/bsky . 
>  
>  Lexicons: for both the com.atproto.* and app.bsky.* are canonically versioned in this repo, for now, under ./lexicons/ . These are JSON files in the Lexicon schema definition language , similar to JSON Schema or OpenAPI. 
>  Interoperability Test Data: the language-neutral test files in ./interop-test-files/ may be useful for other protocol implementations to ensure that they follow the specification correctly 
>  The source code for the Bluesky Social client app (for web and mobile) can be found at bluesky-social/social-app . 
>  Go programming language source code is in bluesky-social/indigo , including the BGS implementation. 
>  Developer Quickstart 
>  We recommend nvm for managing Node.js installs. This project requires Node.js version 18. pnpm is used to manage the workspace of multiple packages. You can install it with npm install --global pnpm . 
>  There is a Makefile which can help with basic development tasks: 
>  # use existing nvm to install node 18 and pnpm 
> make nvm-setup
>  # pull dependencies and build all local packages 
> make deps
> make build
>  # run the tests, using Docker services as needed 
> make test 
>  # run a local PDS and AppView with fake test accounts and data 
>  # (this requires a global installation of `jq` and `docker`) 
> make run-dev-env
>  # show all other commands 
> make help

>  Introduction 
>  This SDK attempts to implement everything that provides ATProto. There is support for Lexicon Schemes, XRPC clients, Firehose, Identity, DID keys, signatures, and more. All models, queries, and procedures are generated automatically. The main focus is on the lexicons of atproto.com and bsky.app, but it doesn't have a vendor lock on it. Feel free to use the code generator for your own lexicon schemes. SDK also provides utilities to work with CID, NSID, AT URI Schemes, DAG-CBOR, CAR files, DID Documents and more. 
>  Requirements 
>  
>  Python 3.8 or higher. 
>  
>  Installing 
>  Quick start 
>  First of all, you need to create the instance of the XRPC Client. To do so, you have two major options: asynchronous, and synchronous. The difference only in import and how you call the methods. If you are not familiar with async, use sync instead. 
>  For sync: 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  client = Client ()
>  # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor 
>  # Client('https://example.com') 
>  For async: 
>  from atproto import AsyncClient 
>  client = AsyncClient ()
>  # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor 
>  # AsyncClient('https://example.com') 
>  In the snippets below, only the sync version will be presented. 
>  Right after the creation of the Client instance, you probably want to access the full API and perform actions by profile. To achieve this, you should log in to the network using your handle and password. The password could be app-specific. 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' ) 
>  You are awesome! Now you feel to pick any high-level method that you want and perform it! 
>  Code to send post: 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  client . send_post ( text = 'Hello World!' )

>  Advanced usage 
>  I'll be honest. The high-level Client that was shown in the "Quick Start" section is not a real ATProto API. This is syntax sugar built upon the real XRPC methods! The high-level methods are not cover the full need of developers. To be able to do anything that you want, you should know to work with low-level API. Let's dive into it! 
>  The basics: 
>  
>  Namespaces – classes that group sub-namespaces and the XRPC queries and procedures. Built upon NSID ATProto semantic. 
>  Model – dataclasses for input, output, and params of the methods from namespaces. Models describe Record and all other types in the Lexicon Schemes. 
>  
>  Namespaces 
>  The client contains references to the root of all namespaces. It's com and app for now. 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  Client (). com 
>  Client (). app 
>  To dive deeper, you can navigate using hints from your IDE. Thanks to well-type hinted SDK, it's much easier. 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  Client (). com . atproto . server . create_session (...)
>  Client (). com . atproto . sync . get_blob (...)
>  Client (). app . bsky . feed . get_likes (...)
>  Client (). app . bsky . graph . get_follows (...) 
>  The endpoint of the path is always the method that you want to call. The method presents a query or procedure in XRPC. You should not care about it much. The only thing you need to know is that the procedures required data objects. Queries could be called with or without params. 
>  Records 
>  In some sub-namespaces, you can find records. Such record classes provide a syntax sugar not defined in the lexicon scheme. This sugar provides a more convenient way to work with repository operations. Such as creating a record, deleting a record, and so on. 
>  Here are some available records of Bluesky records: 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  Client (). app . bsky . feed . post 
>  Client (). app . bsky . feed . like 
>  Client (). app . bsky . graph . follow 
>  Client (). app . bsky . graph . block 
>  Client (). app . bsky . actor . profile 
>  # ... more 
>  Usage example with the post record: 
>  from atproto import AtUri , Client , models 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  posts = client . app . bsky . feed . post . list ( client . me . did , limit = 10 )
>  for uri , post in posts . records . items ():
>  print ( uri , post . text )
>  post = client . app . bsky . feed . post . get ( client . me . did , AtUri . from_str ( uri ). rkey )
>  print ( post . value . text )
>  post_record = models . AppBskyFeedPost . Record ( text = 'test record namespaces' , created_at = client . get_current_time_iso ())
>  new_post = client . app . bsky . feed . post . create ( client . me . did , post_record )
>  print ( new_post )
>  deleted_post = client . app . bsky . feed . post . delete ( client . me . did , AtUri . from_str ( new_post . uri ). rkey )
>  print ( deleted_post ) 
>  Please note that not all repository operations are covered by these syntax sugars. You can always use the low-level methods to perform any desired action. One such action is updating a record. 
>  Models 
>  To deal with methods, we need to deal with models! Models are available in the models module and have NSID-based aliases. Let's take a look at it. 
>  from atproto import models 
>  models . ComAtprotoIdentityResolveHandle 
>  models . AppBskyFeedPost 
>  models . AppBskyActorGetProfile 
>  # 90+ more... 
>  The model classes in the "models" aliases could be: 
>  
>  Data model 
>  Params model 
>  Response model 
>  Sugar response model 
>  Record model 
>  Type model 
>  
>  The only thing you need to know is how to create instances of models. Not with all models, you will work as model-creator. For example, SDK will create Response models for you. 
>  There are a few ways how to create the instance of a model: 
>  
>  Dict-based 
>  Class-based 
>  
>  The instances of data and params models should be passed as arguments to the methods that were described above. 
>  Dict-based: 
>  from atproto import Client 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  # The params model will be created automatically internally for you! 
>  print ( client . com . atproto . identity . resolve_handle ({ 'handle' : 'marshal.dev' })) 
>  Class-based: 
>  from atproto import Client , models 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  params = models . ComAtprotoIdentityResolveHandle . Params ( handle = 'marshal.dev' )
>  print ( client . com . atproto . identity . resolve_handle ( params )) 
>  Tip: look at typehint of the method to figure out the name and the path to the input/data model! 
>  Pro Tip: use IDE autocompletion to find necessary models! Just start typing the method name right after the dot ( models.{type method name in camel case ). 
>  Models could be nested as hell. Be ready for it! 
>  This is how we can send a post with the image using low-level XRPC Client: 
>  from atproto import Client , models 
>  client = Client ()
>  client . login ( 'my-username' , 'my-password' )
>  with open ( 'cat.jpg' , 'rb' ) as f :
>  img_data = f . read ()
>  upload = client . upload_blob ( img_data )
>  images = [ models . AppBskyEmbedImages . Image ( alt = 'Img alt' , image = upload . blob )]
>  embed = models . AppBskyEmbedImages . Main ( images = images )
>  client . com . atproto . repo . create_record (
>  models . ComAtprotoRepoCreateRecord . Data (
>  repo = client . me . did ,
>  collection = models . ids . AppBskyFeedPost ,
>  record = models . AppBskyFeedPost . Record (
>  created_at = client . get_current_time_iso (), text = 'Text of the post' , embed = embed 
> ),
> )
> )
>  # of course, you can use the syntax sugar here instead 
>  post = models . AppBskyFeedPost . Record ( text = 'Text of the post' , embed = embed , created_at = client . get_current_time_iso ())
>  client . app . bsky . feed . post . create ( client . me . did , post )
>  # or even high-level client 
>  client . send_image ( text = 'Text of the post' , image = img_data , image_alt = 'Img alt' )
>  # these three methods are equivalent 
>  I hope you are not scared. May the Force be with you. Good luck!

>  Are you a developer interested in building on atproto? 
>  Bluesky is an open social network built on the AT Protocol, a flexible technology that will never lock developers out of the ecosystems that they help build. With atproto, third-party can be as seamless as first-party through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and more. 
>  If you're a developer interested in building on atproto, we'd love to email you a Bluesky invite code. Simply share your GitHub (or similar) profile with us via this form .

>  Records 
>  The records in your data repository correspond exclusively to your "outbound" actions. For example, if you follow Paul or like one of Paul's posts, those records will be included in your data repository. However, if Paul were to follow you, there would be no record of that in your data repository; only Paul's. 
>  
> The records in your data repository alone can answer the question "who do you follow?" because all of your follow records exist in your data repository. However, in order to answer the question "who follows you?" we would need to check every single user's repo across the entire network and see who has a follow record pointing to your DID. This is also known as having a "global view" of the network, and we'll cover how that works in a bit.
>  
>  Posts, along with all other types of records, are identified using their uri and cid . 
>  
>  The uri can be thought of the path to that record, using the following format: at://[did]/[record-type]/[record-key] . 
>  The cid is the record's commit hash value and is used to cryptographically validate the record. 
>  
>  See an in-depth explanation of post records here 
>  The collections array in a user's data repo indicates all of the record types that that user has created. To retrieve all of a user's records of a given type, like all of their posts or all of their follows, you can use the com.atproto.repo.listRecords lexicon.

>  Most of the data on the protocol is publicly available. However, to access data within the App View (as well as any of your own private data, like mutes) you must authenticate with your regular Bluesky credentials. You can protect your credentials by creating an App Password for your project. 
>  Create a session 
>  Once you authenticate, you receive a session object. This object includes your accessJwt , which is used to authenticate requests and is valid for 2 hours. Your refreshJwt lasts longer and is used only to update the session with a new access token. The session object also includes some basic account information, like your did , handle , and email .

> ozone 
>  Overview 
>  The Ozone project for the AT Protocol consists of 3 components: 
>  
>  A Gradle plugin to compile AT Protocol schemas into usable Kotlin classes. 
>  Multiplatform APIs for the AT Protocol spec that can be used with any compatible service, including Bluesky Social .
>  
>  Supports Android, JVM, JavaScript, and iOS. 
>  
>  
>  Example client apps that demonstrate usage of those APIs. 
>  
>  
>  Warning 
>  🚧 🚧 🚧 Everything in here is very much a work-in-progress!
> The upstream schemas are still subject to breaking
> changes and may break at any moment if used in production code. Use at your own risk! 
>  
>  Why "Ozone"? 
>  O 3 exists at all levels in the ATmosphere . 
>  No relation to the moderation tools also named Ozone .

>  Getting Started 💪 ​ 
>  Install ​ 
>  With Dart: 
>  With Flutter: 
>  Import ​ 
>  Just by writing following one-line import, you can use all endpoints provided by atproto . 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' ; 
>  Instantiate ATProto ​ 
>  You need to use ATProto object to access most of the features supported by atproto . And there are two ways to instantiate an ATProto object. 
>  As shown in the following example, the key point in instantiating ATProto object is whether the endpoint you wish to use requires authentication . 
>  If authentication is required, first create a session with the ATP server using your credentials with the .createSession function. 
>  The credentials passed to the .createSession function should be your handle or email address as identifier and your password or app password as password . 
>  Your credentials will be sent safely and securely to the ATP server when you execute the .createSession function. And it will return a Session object with an access token once authentication is complete. 
>  You then do not need to be particularly aware of the contents of the retrieved Session object, just pass it to the .fromSession constructor of ATProto to safely and securely create an instance of the ATProto object. 
>  Require Auth import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' as atp ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { // Let's authenticate here. final session = await atp . createSession ( identifier : 'YOUR_HANDLE_OR_EMAIL' , // Like "shinyakato.dev" password : 'YOUR_PASSWORD' , ) ; print ( session ) ; // Just pass created session data. final atproto = atp . ATProto . fromSession ( session . data , ) ; } 
>  Or, it's very easy if authentication is not required , simply use the .anonymous() constructor. 
>  Not Require Auth import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { // Just call anonymous constructor. final atproto = ATProto . anonymous ( ) ; } 
>  info See Session Management for more details about authentication.

>  Once an instance of the ATProto object has been created, service endpoints can be used by accessing the property corresponding to each service as follows. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final atproto = ATProto . anonymous ( ) ; // Use `findDID` in `IdentitiesService`. final did = await atproto . identity . resolveHandle ( handle : 'shinyakato.dev' , ) ; } 
>  Let's Implement ​ 
>  Okay then, let's try some endpoints! 
>  The following example first authenticates the user against bsky.social , sends the post to Bluesky, and then deletes it using a reference to the created record. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' as atp ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final session = await atp . createSession ( identifier : 'YOUR_HANDLE_OR_EMAIL' , // Like "shinyakato.dev" password : 'YOUR_PASSWORD' , ) ; final atproto = atp . ATProto . fromSession ( session . data ) ; // Create a record to specific service like Bluesky. final strongRef = await atproto . repo . createRecord ( collection : atp . NSID . create ( 'feed.bsky.app' , 'post' , ) , record : { 'text' : 'Hello, Bluesky!' , "createdAt" : DateTime . now ( ) . toUtc ( ) . toIso8601String ( ) , } , ) ; // And delete it. await atproto . repo . deleteRecord ( uri : strongRef . data . uri , ) ; } 
>  More Tips 🏄 ​ 
>  Session Management ​ 
>  When using the AT Protocol API, there are endpoints that requires user authentication, and an access token created when a user is authenticated is represented as a Session .
> Okay, the most important factor here is how to create a session . 
>  First, use the .createSession function to create the most primitive session as follows. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' as atp ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final session = await atp . createSession ( identifier : 'HANDLE_OR_EMAIL' , // Like shinyakato.dev password : 'PASSWORD' , // App Password is recommended ) ; print ( session ) ; } 
>  Then you can create ATProto object from authenticated session. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' as atp ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final session = await atp . createSession ( identifier : 'HANDLE_OR_EMAIL' , // Like shinyakato.dev password : 'PASSWORD' , // App Password is recommended ) ; print ( session ) ; // You can create ATProto object from authenticated session. final atproto = atp . ATProto . fromSession ( session . data ) ; // Do something with atproto final did = await atproto . identity . resolveHandle ( handle : session . data . handle ) ; } 
>  App Password ​ 
>  info App passwords have most of the same abilities as the user's account password, however they're restricted from destructive actions such as account deletion or account migration . They are also restricted from creating additional app passwords .
> App passwords are of the form xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx . So, it's strongly recommended that App Password be used for login in AT Protocol's services. 
>  Given the above reason, a possible use case is for the application to determine if the password given by the user is an App Password.
> With atproto , you can easily determine if a password is in App Password format by using the .isValidAppPassword function. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' as atp ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { atp . isValidAppPassword ( 'xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx' ) ; // =&gt; true atp . isValidAppPassword ( 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' ) ; // =&gt; false } 
>  The endpoints provided by atproto always access bsky.social by default. But as you know, certain services such as Bluesky, built on the AT Protocol, are distributed services . In other words, there must be a way to access services other than bsky.social as needed. 
>  You can specify any service as follows. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' as atp ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final session = await atp . createSession ( // Add this. service : 'boobee.blue' , identifier : 'YOUR_HANDLE_OR_EMAIL' , password : 'YOUR_PASSWORD' , ) ; final atproto = atp . ATProto . fromSession ( session . data , // Add this, or resolve dynamically based on session. service : 'boobee.blue' , ) ; } 
>  De/Serialize ​ 
>  All objects representing JSON objects returned from the API provided by atproto are generated using freezed and json_serializable . So, it allows for easy JSON-based de/serialize of these model objects based on the common contract between the fromJson and toJson methods. 
>  For example, if you have the following code: 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final atproto = ATProto . anonymous ( ) ; // Just find the DID of `shinyakato.dev` final did = await atproto . identity . resolveHandle ( handle : 'shinyakato.dev' , ) ; } 
>  Then you can deserialize DID object as JSON with toJson as follows: 
>  print ( did . toJson ( ) ) ; // =&gt; {did: did:plc:iijrtk7ocored6zuziwmqq3c} 
>  And you can serialize JSON as DID object with fromJson as follows: 
>  final json = did . toJson ( ) ; final serializedDID = DID . fromJson ( json ) ; 
>  Thrown Exceptions ​ 
>  The following exceptions may be thrown as AT Protocol-related errors when using atproto . The specification of this exception conforms to the following document from the official. 
>  
>  Summary of HTTP Status Codes 
>  
>  Exception Description Retriable XRPCException Parent class of all the following exception classes. ❌ UnauthorizedException Thrown when a status code of 401 is returned from the ATP server. Indicating authentication failure . ❌ RateLimitExceededException Thrown when a status code of 429 is returned from the ATP server. Indicating rate limits exceeded . ❌ XRPCNotSupportedException Thrown when a status code of 1xx or 3xx is returned from the ATP server. Indicating unsupported error . ❌ InvalidRequestException Thrown when a status code of 4xx is returned from the ATP server. Indicating client error . ❌ InternalServerErrorException Thrown when a status code of 5xx is returned from the ATP server. Indicating server error . ✅ 
>  Also, the following exceptions may be thrown due to temporary network failures. 
>  Exception Description Retriable SocketException Thrown when a socket operation fails. ✅ TimeoutException Thrown when a scheduled timeout happens while waiting for an async result. ✅ 
>  info Exceptions with Retriable set to ✅ are subject to automatic retry . Exceptions with ❌ cannot be retried. 
>  Rate Limits ​ 
>  As with Web APIs in general, there is a rate limit for the AT Protocol API.
> The main purpose of setting a rate limit for the API is to prevent excessive requests to the server due to API abuse and to discourage spammy behavior. 
>  Rate limits in the AT Protocol are defined in a common specification for the protocol and are set and you can easily access this information as follows. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' as atp ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final session = await atp . createSession ( service : 'SERVICE_NAME' , identifier : 'YOUR_HANDLE_OR_EMAIL' , password : 'YOUR_PASSWORD' , ) ; final atproto = atp . ATProto . fromSession ( session . data ) ; final response = await atproto . repo . createRecord ( collection : atp . NSID . create ( 'app.bsky.feed' , 'post' , ) , record : { 'text' : 'Hello!' , } , ) ; // This is rate limit! print ( response . rateLimit ) ; final rateLimit = response . rateLimit ; // Available properties. print ( rateLimit . limitCount ) ; print ( rateLimit . remainingCount ) ; print ( rateLimit . resetAt ) ; print ( rateLimit . policy ) ; // When you need to handle rate limits. print ( rateLimit . isExceeded ) ; print ( rateLimit . isNotExceeded ) ; // It waits until the rate limit is reset based on resetAt. // If the rate limit is not exceeded, return immediately. await rateLimit . waitUntilReset ( ) ; } 
>  As in the example above, the rate limits when using atproto are always accessible from XRPCResponse .
> In more detail, rate limit information is read from the HTTP response headers returned by the ATP server and can be accessed via the rateLimit property of the XRPCResponse as a RateLimit object. 
>  The following properties are available from the RateLimit object, which are needed to determine the rate limit for the application. 
>  Property HTTP Header Description limitCount RateLimit-Limit Maximum number of allowed requests. remainingCount RateLimit-Remaining Number of requests that can still be made. resetAt RateLimit-Reset The time when the rate limit will reset. policy RateLimit-Policy The rate limit policy being applied like 100;w=300 . 
>  The properties for each rate limit as shown in the table above are very intuitive and easy to understand. 
>  Slightly different from the HTTP Header information is the resetAt property. This is the date and time the rate limit is reset, not the number of seconds until the rate limit is reset .
> The date and time of the resetAt is calculated using the date and time when the response was created in GMT format in the date field given in the HTTP response header.
> In other words, the value of the resetAt property is the sum of date + RateLimit-Reset given in the HTTP response headers. 
>  With all this out of the way, you can easily handle rate limits in the following way. 
>  final rateLimit = response . rateLimit ; if ( rateLimit . isExceeded ) { // It waits until the rate limit is reset based on resetAt. await rateLimit . waitUntilReset ( ) ; } 
>  caution Rate limits per endpoint must be properly handled. If the request is sent again while the rate limit is exceeded, the HTTP status will always be 429 Too Many Requests and a RateLimitExceededException will be thrown. 
>  tip Some API endpoints have rate limits enabled, while others do not.
> This depends on the authentication method and the characteristics of each endpoint,
> but XRPCResponse always sets the RateLimit object, even for endpoints that do not have rate limiting enabled. So you might ask what happens if you run the .isExceeded property with RateLimit taken from an endpoint that does not have a rate limit in effect?
>  Nothing to worry about . The RateLimit object internally has a flag to indicate whether the rate limit is enabled or not. That is, RateLimit object returned from an endpoint with no rate limit will be set as unlimited , and the isExceeded property will always return false . 
>  Union Types ​ 
>  Since AT Protocol's Lexicon supports the Union type, there are several endpoints where multiple JSONs of different structures are returned at once. However, since Dart does not currently support Union as a language specification, there have been difficulties in marshaling JSON for this Union structure. 
>  atproto solves this problem neatly by using freezed to represent a pseudo-Union type. Besides it's type safe. And all the Union types provided by these atproto are .when(...) methods to handle them cleanly. 
>  See, for example, Firehose API in the next section. 
>  info All Union types provided by atproto always have the property unknown . This is because Union types not supported by atproto cannot be converted to specific model objects when returned from a particular endpoint. When an unknown event occurs, a raw JSON object that has not been marshalled into a specific model object is passed in the callback. This allows us to safely handle Union types with atproto even if they are suddenly added officially, and also allows for more customization. 
>  tip Alternatively, you can handle these union objects more easily using pattern matching supported by Dart3.
> For example, if pattern matching is used, the processing of .when when using the Firehose API is replaced. And all union objects have defined class names prefixed with U .
> So, if you want the Firehose API to handle only Commit and Handle events, you can use the USubscribedRepoCommit and USubscribedRepoHandle objects for pattern matching as follows. import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' as atp ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final atproto = atp . ATProto . anonymous ( ) ; final subscription = await atproto . sync . subscribeRepos ( ) ; await for ( final event in subscription . data . stream ) { // No need to use `.when` method. switch ( event ) { // Specify an union object prefixed with `U` as the case. case atp . USubscribedRepoCommit ( ) : print ( event . data . ops ) ; case atp . USubscribedRepoHandle ( ) : print ( event . data . handle ) ; } } } 
>  Firehose API ​ 
>  atproto makes it easy to work with the powerful Firehose API . 
>  The Firehose API in AT Protocol allows you to get all events that occur on a specific service, such as bsky.social , in real time . This powerful and long-lived API can be used to calculate statistics using real-time data, develop interesting interactive BOTs, etc. 
>  Using atproto to access the Firehose API is very simple, just execute the subscribeRepos method provided by the SyncService as shown in the following example. Also, user authentication is not required to access the Firehose API . 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { // Authentication is not required. final atproto = ATProto . anonymous ( ) ; final subscription = await atproto . sync . subscribeRepos ( ) ; // Get events in real time. await for ( final event in subscription . data . stream ) { event . when ( // Occurs when account committed records, such as Post and Like in Bluesky. commit : ( data ) { // A single commit may contain multiple records. for ( final op in data . ops ) { switch ( op . action ) { case RepoAction . create : case RepoAction . update : // Created/Updated AT URI and specific record. print ( op . uri ) ; print ( op . record ) ; break ; case RepoAction . delete : // Deleted AT URI. print ( op . uri ) ; break ; } } } , // Occurs when account changed handle. handle : ( data ) { // Updated handle. print ( data . handle ) ; print ( data . did ) ; } , migrate : print , tombstone : print , info : print , unknown : print , ) ; } } 
>  The above example may seem a bit difficult, but the SubscribedRepo that can be retrieved in real-time from the Stream is of type Union , so .when(...) method can be used to easily handle each event. 
>  info For more details about Firehose API , you can check this article . 
>  Timeout Duration ​ 
>  When using the ATProto object for API communication, the default timeout period is set to 30 seconds . This means that by default, a TimeoutException will be thrown if API communication takes longer than 30 seconds. 
>  However, depending on system requirements, it may be necessary to set a time shorter than 30 seconds or even longer. 
>  In that case, when creating an instance of the ATProto object, the timeout period can be specified as follows. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final atproto = ATProto . anonymous ( // Add this. timeout : Duration ( seconds : 20 ) , ) ; } 
>  Advanced Built-In Retry ​ 
>  atproto has an advanced retry feature using the Exponential BackOff And Jitter algorithm. 
>  The reason why retry processing is so important in API communication is because the nature of the process of communicating with external servers means that there is always the possibility of temporary errors, such as network failures. In the event of a network failure, rather than throwing an exception and terminating the process, waiting for a while and retrying the process will often work. 
>  And the algorithm is also important when retrying. This is because if the retry algorithm is simply one that waits and retries every fixed period of time, multiple retry requests will be sent to the server simultaneously before the temporary network failure is resolved. This condition will cause the server, which is temporarily out of shape, to generate even more heat. 
>  The Exponential BackOff And Jitter used by atproto solves this problem. atproto uses a sophisticated algorithm with random numbers to distribute the load on the server while improving the probability of success on retries. 
>  note Jitter means random number. 
>  You can use this retry features as follows. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final atproto = ATProto . anonymous ( // Add this. retryConfig : RetryConfig ( // Required. // You can set count of attempts. maxAttempts : 3 , // Optional. // Jitter can be specified as you want. jitter : Jitter ( maxInSeconds : 10 , minInSeconds : 5 , ) , // Optional. // You can define the events that occur when Retry is executed. onExecute : ( event ) = &gt; print ( 'Retry after ${ event . intervalInSeconds } seconds...' '[ ${ event . retryCount } times]' , ) , ) , ) ; } 
>  Then it retries: 
>  
>  When the status code of the response returned from ATP server is 5xx 
>  When the network is temporarily lost and a SocketException is thrown 
>  When communication times out temporarily and a TimeoutException is thrown 
>  
>  Lexicon/Object IDs ​ 
>  Some objects returned from AT Protocol's API are identified by IDs defined in Lexicon. The ID defined in Lexicon is also very important when sending a request to the API server. 
>  atproto provides all the IDs defined in Lexicon for com.atproto.* as constants, and it can be easily used from package:atproto/ids.dart as follows. 
>  import 'package:atproto/ids.dart' as ids ; void main ( ) { // `blob` ids . blob ; // `com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos#commit` ids . comAtprotoSyncSubscribeReposCommit ; } 
>  note These ID constants are automatically maintained when a new Lexicon is officially added. See script . 
>  Pagination in the AT Protocol is designed to be performed using cursor . cursor is a string indicating the beginning of the next page, and is returned by the ATP server if the next page exists. 
>  note For more details about design of pagination and cursor in the AT Protocol, see official . 
>  atproto also follows the common design of AT Protocol and allows paging by using cursor . It can be easily implemented as in the following example. 
>  import 'package:atproto/atproto.dart' as atp ; Future &lt; void &gt; main ( ) async { final atproto = atp . ATProto . fromSession ( await _session ) ; // Pagination is performed on a per-cursor basis. String ? nextCursor ; do { final records = await atproto . repo . listRecords ( repo : 'shinyakato.dev' , collection : atp . NSID . create ( 'graph.bsky.app' , 'follow' , ) , cursor : nextCursor , // If null, it is ignored. ) ; for ( final record in records . data . records ) { print ( record ) ; } // Update pagination cursor. nextCursor = records . data . cursor ; } while ( nextCursor != null ) ; // If there is no next page, it ends. } 
>  tip Endpoints that can be paged can be seen in this matrix . 
>  This example is a very simple implementation, but it allows us to see pagination using atproto . 
>  Whenever a method corresponding to a pagination-available endpoint is executed, the cursor is always present in the root of the response data, like records.data.cursor above.
> If the next page does not exist, cursor is basically null .

> **TypeScript Services:**
> 
> * `pds`: "Personal Data Server", hosting repo content for atproto accounts. Most implementation code in `packages/pds`, with runtime wrapper in `services/pds`. See [bluesky-social/pds](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds) for directions on self-hosting.
> * `bsky`: AppView implementation of the `app.bsky.*` API endpoints. Running on main network at `api.bsky.app`. Most implementation code in `packages/bsky`, with runtime wrapper in `services/bsky`.
> 
> **Lexicons:** for both the `com.atproto.*` and `app.bsky.*` are canonically versioned in this repo, for now, under `./lexicons/`. These are JSON files in the [Lexicon schema definition language](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon), similar to JSON Schema or OpenAPI.
> 
> **Interoperability Test Data:** the language-neutral test files in `./interop-test-files/` may be useful for other protocol implementations to ensure that they follow the specification correctly
> 
> The source code for the Bluesky Social client app (for web and mobile) can be found at [bluesky-social/social-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app).
> 
> Go programming language source code is in [bluesky-social/indigo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo), including the BGS implementation.
> 
> ## Developer Quickstart
> 
> [](#developer-quickstart)
> 
> We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node.js installs. This project requires Node.js version 18\. `pnpm` is used to manage the workspace of multiple packages. You can install it with `npm install --global pnpm`.
> 
> There is a Makefile which can help with basic development tasks:
> 
> # use existing nvm to install node 18 and pnpm
> make nvm-setup
> 
> # pull dependencies and build all local packages
> make deps
> make build
> 
> # run the tests, using Docker services as needed
> make test
> 
> # run a local PDS and AppView with fake test accounts and data
> # (this requires a global installation of `jq` and `docker`)
> make run-dev-env
> 
> # show all other commands
> make help

> ## ATP API
> 
> [](#atp-api)
> 
> This API is a client for ATProtocol servers. It communicates using HTTP. It includes:
> 
> * ✔️ APIs for ATProto and Bluesky.
> * ✔️ Validation and complete typescript types.
> * ✔️ Session management.
> * ✔️ A RichText library.
> 
> ## Getting started
> 
> [](#getting-started)
> 
> First install the package:
> 
> Then in your application:
> 
> import { AtpAgent } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> const agent = new AtpAgent({ service: 'https://example.com' })
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> [](#usage)
> 
> ### Session management
> 
> [](#session-management)
> 
> You'll need an authenticated session for most API calls. There are two ways to manage sessions:
> 
> 1. [App password based session management](#app-password-based-session-management)
> 2. [OAuth based session management](#oauth-based-session-management)
> 
> #### App password based session management
> 
> [](#app-password-based-session-management)
> 
> Username / password based authentication can be performed using the `AtpAgent`class.
> 
> Caution
> 
> This method is deprecated in favor of OAuth based session management. It is recommended to use OAuth based session management (through the`@atproto/oauth-client-*` packages).
> 
> import { AtpAgent, AtpSessionEvent, AtpSessionData } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> // configure connection to the server, without account authentication
> const agent = new AtpAgent({
>   service: 'https://example.com',
>   persistSession: (evt: AtpSessionEvent, sess?: AtpSessionData) => {
>     // store the session-data for reuse
>   },
> })
> 
> // Change the agent state to an authenticated state either by:
> 
> // 1) creating a new account on the server.
> await agent.createAccount({
>   email: 'alice@mail.com',
>   password: 'hunter2',
>   handle: 'alice.example.com',
>   inviteCode: 'some-code-12345-abcde',
> })
> 
> // 2) if an existing session was securely stored previously, then reuse that to resume the session.
> await agent.resumeSession(savedSessionData)
> 
> // 3) if no old session was available, create a new one by logging in with password (App Password)
> await agent.login({
>   identifier: 'alice@mail.com',
>   password: 'hunter2',
> })
> 
> #### OAuth based session management
> 
> [](#oauth-based-session-management)
> 
> Depending on the environment used by your application, different OAuth clients are available:
> 
> * [@atproto/oauth-client-browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client-browser): for the browser.
> * [@atproto/oauth-client-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client-node): for Node.js.
> * [@atproto/oauth-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/oauth-client): Lower level; compatible with most JS engines.
> 
> Every `@atproto/oauth-client-*` implementation has a different way to obtain an`OAuthSession` instance that can be used to instantiate an `Agent` (from`@atproto/api`). Here is an example restoring a previously saved session:
> 
> import { Agent } from '@atproto/api'
> import { OAuthClient } from '@atproto/oauth-client'
> 
> const oauthClient = new OAuthClient({
>   // ...
> })
> 
> const oauthSession = await oauthClient.restore('did:plc:123')
> 
> // Instantiate the api Agent using an OAuthSession
> const agent = new Agent(oauthSession)
> 
> ### API calls
> 
> [](#api-calls)
> 
> The agent includes methods for many common operations, including:
> 
> // The DID of the user currently authenticated (or undefined)
> agent.did
> agent.accountDid // Throws if the user is not authenticated
> 
> // Feeds and content
> await agent.getTimeline(params, opts)
> await agent.getAuthorFeed(params, opts)
> await agent.getPostThread(params, opts)
> await agent.getPost(params)
> await agent.getPosts(params, opts)
> await agent.getLikes(params, opts)
> await agent.getRepostedBy(params, opts)
> await agent.post(record)
> await agent.deletePost(postUri)
> await agent.like(uri, cid)
> await agent.deleteLike(likeUri)
> await agent.repost(uri, cid)
> await agent.deleteRepost(repostUri)
> await agent.uploadBlob(data, opts)
> 
> // Social graph
> await agent.getFollows(params, opts)
> await agent.getFollowers(params, opts)
> await agent.follow(did)
> await agent.deleteFollow(followUri)
> 
> // Actors
> await agent.getProfile(params, opts)
> await agent.upsertProfile(updateFn)
> await agent.getProfiles(params, opts)
> await agent.getSuggestions(params, opts)
> await agent.searchActors(params, opts)
> await agent.searchActorsTypeahead(params, opts)
> await agent.mute(did)
> await agent.unmute(did)
> await agent.muteModList(listUri)
> await agent.unmuteModList(listUri)
> await agent.blockModList(listUri)
> await agent.unblockModList(listUri)
> 
> // Notifications
> await agent.listNotifications(params, opts)
> await agent.countUnreadNotifications(params, opts)
> await agent.updateSeenNotifications()
> 
> // Identity
> await agent.resolveHandle(params, opts)
> await agent.updateHandle(params, opts)
> 
> // Legacy: Session management should be performed through the SessionManager
> // rather than the Agent instance.
> if (agent instanceof AtpAgent) {
>   // AtpAgent instances support using different sessions during their lifetime
>   await agent.createAccount({ ... }) // session a
>   await agent.login({ ... }) // session b
>   await agent.resumeSession(savedSession) // session c
> }
> 
> ### Validation and types
> 
> [](#validation-and-types)
> 
> The package includes a complete types system which includes validation and type-guards. For example, to validate a post record:
> 
> import { AppBskyFeedPost } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> const post = {...}
> if (AppBskyFeedPost.isRecord(post)) {
>   // typescript now recognizes `post` as a AppBskyFeedPost.Record
>   // however -- we still need to validate it
>   const res = AppBskyFeedPost.validateRecord(post)
>   if (res.success) {
>     // a valid record
>   } else {
>     // something is wrong
>     console.log(res.error)
>   }
> }
> 
> ### Rich text
> 
> [](#rich-text)
> 
> Some records (ie posts) use the `app.bsky.richtext` lexicon. At the moment richtext is only used for links and mentions, but it will be extended over time to include bold, italic, and so on.
> 
> ℹ️ It is **strongly** recommended to use this package's `RichText` library. Javascript encodes strings in utf16 while the protocol (and most other programming environments) use utf8\. Converting between the two is challenging, but `RichText` handles that for you.
> 
> import { RichText } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> // creating richtext
> const rt = new RichText({
>   text: 'Hello @alice.com, check out this link: https://example.com',
> })
> await rt.detectFacets(agent) // automatically detects mentions and links
> const postRecord = {
>   $type: 'app.bsky.feed.post',
>   text: rt.text,
>   facets: rt.facets,
>   createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
> }
> 
> // rendering as markdown
> let markdown = ''
> for (const segment of rt.segments()) {
>   if (segment.isLink()) {
>     markdown += `[${segment.text}](${segment.link?.uri})`
>   } else if (segment.isMention()) {
>     markdown += `[${segment.text}](https://my-bsky-app.com/user/${segment.mention?.did})`
>   } else {
>     markdown += segment.text
>   }
> }
> 
> // calculating string lengths
> const rt2 = new RichText({ text: 'Hello' })
> console.log(rt2.length) // => 5
> console.log(rt2.graphemeLength) // => 5
> const rt3 = new RichText({ text: '👨‍👩‍👧‍👧' })
> console.log(rt3.length) // => 25

> ### Moderation
> 
> [](#moderation)
> 
> Applying the moderation system is a challenging task, but we've done our best to simplify it for you. The Moderation API helps handle a wide range of tasks, including:
> 
> * Moderator labeling
> * User muting (including mutelists)
> * User blocking
> * Mutewords
> * Hidden posts
> 
> For more information, see the [Moderation Documentation](/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/packages/api/docs/moderation.md).

> 
> The AT Protocol identifies methods and records with reverse-DNS names. You can use them on the agent as well:

>     createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
>   },
> })
> const res2 = await agent.com.atproto.repo.listRecords({
>   repo: alice.did,
>   collection: 'app.bsky.feed.post',
> })
> 
> const res3 = await agent.app.bsky.feed.post.create(
>   { repo: alice.did },
>   {
>     text: 'Hello, world!',
>     createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
>   },
> )
> const res4 = await agent.app.bsky.feed.post.list({ repo: alice.did })
> 
> ### Non-browser configuration
> 
> [](#non-browser-configuration)
> 
> If your environment doesn't have a built-in `fetch` implementation, you'll need to provide one. This will typically be done through a polyfill.
> 
> ### Bring your own fetch
> 
> [](#bring-your-own-fetch)
> 
> If you want to provide your own `fetch` implementation, you can do so by instantiating the sessionManager with a custom fetch implementation:
> 
> import { AtpAgent } from '@atproto/api'
> 
> const myFetch = (input: RequestInfo | URL, init?: RequestInit) => {
>   console.log('requesting', input)
>   const response = await globalThis.fetch(input, init)

> ### Introduction
> 
> [](#introduction)
> 
> This SDK attempts to implement everything that provides ATProto. There is support for Lexicon Schemes, XRPC clients, Firehose, Identity, DID keys, signatures, and more. All models, queries, and procedures are generated automatically. The main focus is on the lexicons of atproto.com and bsky.app, but it doesn't have a vendor lock on it. Feel free to use the code generator for your own lexicon schemes. The SDK also provides utilities to work with CID, NSID, AT URI Schemes, DAG-CBOR, CAR files, DID Documents and more.
> 
> ### Requirements
> 
> [](#requirements)
> 
> * Python 3.8 or higher.
> 
> ### Installing
> 
> [](#installing)
> 
> ### Quick start
> 
> [](#quick-start)
> 
> First of all, you need to create the instance of the XRPC Client. To do so, you have two major options: asynchronous and synchronous. The difference is only in the import and how you call the methods. If you are not familiar with async, use sync instead.
> 
> For sync:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor
> # Client('https://example.com')
> 
> For async:
> 
> from atproto import AsyncClient
> 
> client = AsyncClient()
> # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor
> # AsyncClient('https://example.com')
> 
> In the snippets below, only the sync version will be presented.
> 
> Right after the creation of the Client instance, you will probably want to access the full API and perform actions by profile. To achieve this, you should log into the network using your handle and password. The password could be app-specific.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> 
> You are awesome! Now feel free to pick any high-level method that you want and try it out!
> 
> Code to send a post:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> client.send_post(text='Hello World!')
> 
> Useful links to continue:

> [](#documentation)
> 
> The documentation is live at [atproto.blue](https://atproto.blue/).
> 
> ### Getting help
> 
> [](#getting-help)
> 
> You can get help in several ways:
> 
> * Report bugs, request new features by [creating an issue](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/issues/new).
> * Ask questions by [starting a discussion](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/discussions/new).
> * Ask questions in [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PCyVJXU9jN).
> 
> ### Advanced usage
> 
> [](#advanced-usage)
> 
> I'll be honest. The high-level Client that was shown in the "Quick Start" section is not a real ATProto API. This is syntax sugar built upon the real XRPC methods! The high-level methods do not cover the full needs of developers. To be able to do anything that you want, you should know how to work with low-level API. Let's dive into it!
> 
> The basics:
> 
> * Namespaces – classes that group sub-namespaces and the XRPC queries and procedures. Built upon NSID ATProto semantic.
> * Model – dataclasses for input, output, and params of the methods from namespaces. Models describe Record and all other types in the Lexicon Schemes.
> 
> #### Namespaces
> 
> [](#namespaces)
> 
> The client contains references to the root of all namespaces. It's `com` and `app` for now.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().com
> Client().app
> 
> To dive deeper, you can navigate using hints from your IDE. Thanks to a well-type hinted SDK, it's much easier.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().com.atproto.server.create_session(...)
> Client().com.atproto.sync.get_blob(...)
> Client().app.bsky.feed.get_likes(...)
> Client().app.bsky.graph.get_follows(...)
> 
> The endpoint of the path is always the method you want to call. The method presents a query or procedure in XRPC. You should not care about it much. The only thing you need to know is that the procedures require data objects. Queries could be called with or without params.
> 
> #### Records
> 
> [](#records)
> 
> In some sub-namespaces, you can find records. Such record classes provide a syntax sugar not defined in the lexicon scheme. This sugar provides a more convenient way to work with repository operations, such as creating a record, deleting a record, and so on.
> 
> Here are some available records of Bluesky records:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().app.bsky.feed.post
> Client().app.bsky.feed.like
> Client().app.bsky.graph.follow
> Client().app.bsky.graph.block
> Client().app.bsky.actor.profile
> # ... more
> 
> Usage example with the `post` record:
> 
> from atproto import AtUri, Client, models
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> 
> posts = client.app.bsky.feed.post.list(client.me.did, limit=10)
> for uri, post in posts.records.items():
>     print(uri, post.text)
> 
> post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.get(client.me.did, AtUri.from_str(uri).rkey)
> print(post.value.text)
> 
> post_record = models.AppBskyFeedPost.Record(text='test record namespaces', created_at=client.get_current_time_iso())
> new_post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.create(client.me.did, post_record)
> print(new_post)
> 
> deleted_post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.delete(client.me.did, AtUri.from_str(new_post.uri).rkey)
> print(deleted_post)
>

> ### Introduction[¶](#introduction "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> This SDK attempts to implement everything that provides ATProto. There is support for Lexicon Schemes, XRPC clients, Firehose, Identity, DID keys, signatures, and more. All models, queries, and procedures are generated automatically. The main focus is on the lexicons of atproto.com and bsky.app, but it doesn’t have a vendor lock on it. Feel free to use the code generator for your own lexicon schemes. The SDK also provides utilities to work with CID, NSID, AT URI Schemes, DAG-CBOR, CAR files, DID Documents and more.
> 
> ### Requirements[¶](#requirements "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> * Python 3.8 or higher.
> 
> ### Installing[¶](#installing "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> ### Quick start[¶](#quick-start "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> First of all, you need to create the instance of the XRPC Client. To do so, you have two major options: asynchronous and synchronous. The difference is only in the import and how you call the methods. If you are not familiar with async, use sync instead.
> 
> For sync:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor
> # Client('https://example.com')
> 
> For async:
> 
> from atproto import AsyncClient
> 
> client = AsyncClient()
> # By default, it uses the server of bsky.app. To change this behavior, pass the base api URL to constructor
> # AsyncClient('https://example.com')
> 
> In the snippets below, only the sync version will be presented.
> 
> Right after the creation of the Client instance, you will probably want to access the full API and perform actions by profile. To achieve this, you should log into the network using your handle and password. The password could be app-specific.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> 
> You are awesome! Now feel free to pick any high-level method that you want and try it out!
> 
> Code to send a post:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> client.send_post(text='Hello World!')
> 
> Useful links to continue:
> 
> * [List of all methods with documentation](https://atproto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/atproto%5Fclient/index.html).
> * [Examples of using the methods](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/tree/main/examples).

> ### SDK structure[¶](#sdk-structure "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> The SDK is built upon the following components:
> 
> | Package           | Description                                                                 |
> | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | atproto           | Import shortcuts to other packages.                                         |
> | atproto\_cli      | CLI tool to generate code.                                                  |
> | atproto\_client   | XRPC Client, data models, and utils like rich text helper.                  |
> | atproto\_codegen  | Code generator of models, clients, and namespaces.                          |
> | atproto\_core     | Tools to work with NSID, AT URI Schemes, CID, CAR files, and DID Documents. |
> | atproto\_crypto   | Crypto utils like multibase, signature verification, work with DID keys.    |
> | atproto\_firehose | Firehose (data streaming) client and models.                                |
> | atproto\_identity | Identity resolvers for DID, Handle, AT Protocol data, signing keys.         |
> | atproto\_lexicon  | Lexicon parser.                                                             |
> | atproto\_server   | Server-side utils like JWT.                                                 |
> 
> I highly recommend that you use the `atproto` package to import everything that you need. It contains shortcuts to all other packages.

> ### Documentation[¶](#documentation "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> The documentation is live at [atproto.blue](https://atproto.blue/).
> 
> ### Getting help[¶](#getting-help "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> You can get help in several ways:
> 
> * Report bugs, request new features by [creating an issue](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/issues/new).
> * Ask questions by [starting a discussion](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/discussions/new).
> * Ask questions in [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PCyVJXU9jN).
> 
> ### Advanced usage[¶](#advanced-usage "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> I’ll be honest. The high-level Client that was shown in the “Quick Start” section is not a real ATProto API. This is syntax sugar built upon the real XRPC methods! The high-level methods do not cover the full needs of developers. To be able to do anything that you want, you should know how to work with low-level API. Let’s dive into it!
> 
> The basics:
> 
> * Namespaces – classes that group sub-namespaces and the XRPC queries and procedures. Built upon NSID ATProto semantic.
> * Model – dataclasses for input, output, and params of the methods from namespaces. Models describe Record and all other types in the Lexicon Schemes.
> 
> #### Namespaces[¶](#namespaces "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> The client contains references to the root of all namespaces. It’s `com` and `app` for now.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().com
> Client().app
> 
> To dive deeper, you can navigate using hints from your IDE. Thanks to a well-type hinted SDK, it’s much easier.
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().com.atproto.server.create_session(...)
> Client().com.atproto.sync.get_blob(...)
> Client().app.bsky.feed.get_likes(...)
> Client().app.bsky.graph.get_follows(...)
> 
> The endpoint of the path is always the method you want to call. The method presents a query or procedure in XRPC. You should not care about it much. The only thing you need to know is that the procedures require data objects. Queries could be called with or without params.
> 
> #### Records[¶](#records "Permalink to this heading")
> 
> In some sub-namespaces, you can find records. Such record classes provide a syntax sugar not defined in the lexicon scheme. This sugar provides a more convenient way to work with repository operations, such as creating a record, deleting a record, and so on.
> 
> Here are some available records of Bluesky records:
> 
> from atproto import Client
> 
> Client().app.bsky.feed.post
> Client().app.bsky.feed.like
> Client().app.bsky.graph.follow
> Client().app.bsky.graph.block
> Client().app.bsky.actor.profile
> # ... more
> 
> Usage example with the `post` record:
> 
> from atproto import AtUri, Client, models
> 
> client = Client()
> client.login('my-username', 'my-password')
> 
> posts = client.app.bsky.feed.post.list(client.me.did, limit=10)
> for uri, post in posts.records.items():
>     print(uri, post.text)
> 
> post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.get(client.me.did, AtUri.from_str(uri).rkey)
> print(post.value.text)
> 
> post_record = models.AppBskyFeedPost.Record(text='test record namespaces', created_at=client.get_current_time_iso())
> new_post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.create(client.me.did, post_record)
> print(new_post)
> 
> deleted_post = client.app.bsky.feed.post.delete(client.me.did, AtUri.from_str(new_post.uri).rkey)
> print(deleted_post)
>

> **This library is a Bluesky/ATProtocol client library compatible with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html).**It depends on [khttpclient](https://github.com/uakihir0/khttpclient) and uses Ktor Client internally. Therefore, this library can be used on any platform supported by Kotlin Multiplatform and Ktor Client. The behavior on each platform depends on [khttpclient](https://github.com/uakihir0/khttpclient).
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> [](#usage)
> 
> Below is how to use it with Kotlin on the supported platforms using Gradle.  
> **If you are using it on an Apple platform, please refer to [kbsky-cocoapods](https://github.com/uakihir0/kbsky-cocoapods).**  
> Additionally, please check the test code as well.

> > Key Improvements and Explanations:
> > 
> > *   **`codegen` Package:**  This is *crucially* important.  It houses the Lexicon code generator, separated into:
> >     *   `LexiconParser`:  Parses the JSON Lexicon files.  You can use the built in `java.util.spi.ToolProvider` to create a `jar` tool provider for the generator, which is built into Java.
> >     *   `ModelGenerator`:  Generates Java record classes (for data models) based on the parsed Lexicon.
> >     *   `ClientGenerator`: Generates the `com.atproto.api` methods based on the parsed Lexicon (similar to how the Python SDK does it).
> >     *   `Generator`: Provides a main class to tie the generator all together.
> > *   **`models` Package Structure:**  The `models` package now mirrors the Lexicon namespaces *exactly*, using nested packages (e.g., `com.atproto.repo`, `app.bsky.feed`). This is the standard way to organize data models in a Java project of this nature, and it provides excellent clarity and maintainability. You should include any inner classes in their respective files.
> > *   **`common` Package:**  This package contains utilities that are *not* specific to XRPC or the Bluesky API but are used across the library. This includes `Nsid`, `Cid`, and `AtUri` classes.
> 
> ```
> 
> ```md
>  docs/chats/20250323T213831_session.md
> > Also assume that I will be creating a a code generator to pull/generate Lexicons (like the Typescript implementation does). This generator will need to be a part of this project.
> > README.md   Present to me as complete of a file tree as possible for me to build from, using my current codebase as an example. Feel free to delete redundant or unnecessary Java files.
> 
> #### _Assistant_
> 
> > Okay, here's a revised and more complete file tree structure, taking into account the additional information, the existing implementations (Go, Python, Kotlin), the need for a Lexicon code generator, and best practices for a Java library.  I've also incorporated feedback from the previous iterations and added more detail where appropriate. I've also refined the structure based on your existing codebase and removed a few things that are unlikely to be necessary.

> > Java 21 LTS Maven Documentation I want to build a Java implementation of Bluesky's ATProtocol. The goal is to build a package JAR file that anyone can use as a base to build a Java program from. I want to utilize the official Typescript imlementation as a reference to preferably port their code to Java, or to build my own version from.
> > Create a file tree of this project using the supplied Typescript, Go, Python, and Kotlin implementations as examples. Keep in mind that the Typescript implementation is the most complete and is tested completely working - the others only partially implement ATProtocol. Also keep in mind common ways on how Java libraries are structured. I do not want to use any additional libraries outside of the Java 21 SDK if at all possible (keep it as "pure Java" as possible). For any tests found in those repos, assume that I will be using JUnit in my project.

> > * `pds`: "Personal Data Server", hosting repo content for atproto accounts. Most implementation code in `packages/pds`, with runtime wrapper in `services/pds`. See [bluesky-social/pds](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds) for directions on self-hosting.
> > * `bsky`: AppView implementation of the `app.bsky.*` API endpoints. Running on main network at `api.bsky.app`. Most implementation code in `packages/bsky`, with runtime wrapper in `services/bsky`.
> > 
> > **Lexicons:** for both the `com.atproto.*` and `app.bsky.*` are canonically versioned in this repo, for now, under `./lexicons/`. These are JSON files in the [Lexicon schema definition language](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon), similar to JSON Schema or OpenAPI.
> > 
> > **Interoperability Test Data:** the language-neutral test files in `./interop-test-files/` may be useful for other protocol implementations to ensure that they follow the specification correctly

> Java 21 LTS Maven Documentation I want to build a Java implementation of Bluesky's ATProtocol. The goal is to build a package JAR file that anyone can use as a base to build a Java program from. I want to utilize the official Typescript imlementation as a reference to preferably port their code to Java, or to build my own version from.
> README.md   We're going to build out the Lexicon generator. It needs to be as complete as the Typescript implementation since that's the one that's absolutely confirmed working. But you also need to factor in the other versions - especially the Kotlin version (since Kotlin is a "dielect" of Java).
> Let's build it using a test-driven development model. Let's begin by building out the JUnit tests first.

#### _Assistant_

> Okay, let's start building the test-driven development (TDD) foundation for the Lexicon generator, focusing on `LexiconParserTest.java` first.  We'll use JUnit 5 (Jupiter) for this.  We'll draw inspiration from the TypeScript, Python, and Kotlin implementations, but prioritize a Java-idiomatic approach. The most important things will be parsing various example json schema files, edge cases found in the Typescript implementation. Since this is the parser, handling resolution of references and remote schemas will be handled *later*.
> 
> Here's the `src/test/java/com/atproto/codegen/LexiconParserTest.java` file, with a good set of initial test cases. I'll include comments explaining the *purpose* of each test, referring back to the conceptual elements of Lexicon:

> Key improvements and explanations in this test suite:
> 
> *   **Comprehensive Coverage:**  The tests cover a wide variety of Lexicon elements:
>     *   Basic structure (lexicon version, id, defs).
>     *   Descriptions (at the top level and within definitions).
>     *   Primitive types: `integer`, `string`, `boolean`.  And their specific attributes.
>     *   Arrays and the `items` property.
>     *   `ref` and `union` types (critical for AT Protocol).
>     *   `token`, `unknown`, `bytes`, and `cid-link` types.
>     *   Full `record` definitions.
>     *   Query, Procedure and Subscription definitions, including schemas for `output`.
>     *  Subscriptions and their unique `message` parameter.
> *   **Error Handling:** Tests specifically check for expected exceptions:
>     *   `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid Lexicon versions, or missing required fields.
>     *   `IOException` for general parsing failures (invalid JSON).
> *   **Type Safety:** Uses `instanceof` checks *before* casting to ensure type safety, which is critical for a robust parser.  This prevents unexpected `ClassCastException` errors.
> *   **Optional Handling:** The code explicitly uses `.get()` on `Optional` values, after null/existence checks. This demonstrates correct interaction with the model's Optionals.
> *   **Readability:**  The tests are clearly named and use descriptive variable names.  The JSON is formatted for easy reading.
> *   **JUnit 5:** Uses JUnit 5 (Jupiter) annotations (`@Test`, `assertThrows`, `assertEquals`, `assertNotNull`, etc.).
> * **Test-Driven Development:** This fulfills the test-driven development by creating comprehensive test cases *before* the parser's logic is implemented. Each test tests a minimal part of the overall parser.
> 
> Next steps in TDD:
> 
> 1.  **Implement `LexiconParser`:** Now that you have a robust set of tests, start implementing the `LexiconParser.java` class, method by method.  Make the tests pass, one by one.
> 2. **Refactor:** The code should be built iteratively, expanding on both test cases and method implementations equally.
> 3.  **Iterate:**  As you encounter more complex Lexicon examples or edge cases, add new tests *before* modifying the parser.
> 
> This approach will ensure that your Lexicon parser is robust, well-tested, and correctly handles the nuances of the Lexicon specification. Remember to keep the tests focused and specific to make debugging easier.

#### _Assistant_

> Okay, let's create a `pom.xml` file for your `atproto-java` project. Since you're aiming for a pure Java 21 project without external dependencies (beyond JUnit for testing), the POM will be relatively straightforward. Here's a complete `pom.xml`, followed by explanations:

> Key elements and explanations:
> 
> *   **`<modelVersion>`:**  Always `4.0.0` for Maven 2/3.
> *   **`<groupId>`:**  Your reverse domain name (or organization's).  `com.atproto` is a good choice, or `io.github.yourusername`.
> *   **`<artifactId>`:**  The name of your library (`atproto-java`).
> *   **`<version>`:**  Start with a snapshot version (e.g., `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`).  Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as you develop.
> *   **`<packaging>`:** `jar` is the standard for Java libraries.
> *   **`<name>` and `<description>`:**  Provide human-readable information about your library.
> *   **`<url>`:**  Point this to your GitHub repository (once it exists).
> *   **`<properties>`:**
>     *   `project.build.sourceEncoding`: Sets UTF-8 encoding (essential for consistent builds).
>     *   `maven.compiler.source` and `maven.compiler.target`:  Set both to `21` to ensure Java 21 compatibility.
>     *    `junit.version`: Defines a single place to update the JUnit version.
> *   **`<dependencies>`:**
>     *   **JUnit Jupiter:** Includes `junit-jupiter-api` (for writing tests), `junit-jupiter-engine` (for running tests), and `junit-jupiter-params` (for parameterized tests).  The `scope` is set to `test`, meaning these dependencies are *only* needed during testing, not when using the library.
> *   **`<build>`/`<plugins>`:**
>     *   **`maven-compiler-plugin`:**  Configures the Java compiler.  We set `source`, `target`, and `release` to `21`.
>     *   **`maven-surefire-plugin`:**  Runs the unit tests during the build.  It automatically finds JUnit 5 tests.
>     *    **`maven-jar-plugin`:**  Configures how the JAR file is built. The suggested config also handles the creation of a manifest (you can add a `Main-Class` entry if you make an executable JAR, but in this case, we are building a library so we don't need that).
>         *  **`maven-javadoc-plugin`**: Generates javadoc during build. Includes proper configuration to include source version, as well javadoc:jar execution to create a JAR file when packaged.
>     *   **`maven-source-plugin`:**  Generates a JAR containing the source code.  This is very helpful for users of your library who want to see the source in their IDE.
> 
> How to use this POM:
> 
> 1.  **Save:** Save this XML as `pom.xml` in the root of your `atproto-java` project.
> 2.  **Build:**  From the command line (in the `atproto-java` directory), run:
>     ```bash
>     mvn clean install
>     ```
>     This will:
>     *   Compile your code.
>     *   Run your unit tests.
>     *   Create the JAR file (`target/atproto-java-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`).
>     *    It may also make a javadoc jar, and sources jar.
>     *   Install the JAR into your local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`).  This makes it available to other projects on your machine.
> 3.   **Test:** Run:
>   		  ```bash
>   		mvn test
>   		```
> 
> 4.  **Generate Javadoc:** Run:
>     ```bash
>     mvn javadoc:javadoc
>     ```
>     The generated Javadoc will be in `target/site/apidocs`.
> 
> 5.  **Generate Javadoc Jar:** Will automatically be performed running `mvn clean install`.
> 6.  **Generate Sources Jar:** Will automatically be performed running `mvn clean install`.
> 
> This `pom.xml` provides a solid foundation for a professional-quality Java library. It includes everything needed for building, testing, generating documentation, and packaging the project for distribution.  It also correctly sets up the project for Java 21.  It's ready for use with a continuous integration (CI) system.

#### _User_

> Okay. Anything else that needs to go in LexiconParserTest.java?

#### _Assistant_

> Yes, there are a few more important areas and specific test cases we should add to `LexiconParserTest.java` to make it more robust and cover more of the Lexicon specification. These additions will focus on:
> 
> 1.  **More complex data types and structures:**  Testing nested objects, arrays of complex types.
> 2.  **Error cases related to structure and type mismatches:**  Ensuring the parser throws appropriate exceptions when the Lexicon is malformed.
> 3. **Testing `defs` other than `main`**
> 4.  **Testing `xrpcQuery`,`xrpcProcedure`, and `xrpcSubscription` parameters, input, outputs and messages.**
> 5. **Testing `blob` type**
> 
> Here's an expanded version of `LexiconParserTest.java`, incorporating these additions. I'll add comments to explain the new tests:

> Key Changes and Additional Tests:
> 
> *   **`testParseMultipleDefs`:**  Checks that the parser correctly handles multiple definitions within the `defs` object (not just `main`).
> *   **`testParseNestedObjects`:**  Verifies that nested object structures are parsed correctly.  This is *crucial* for real-world Lexicons.
> *   **`testParseArrayOfObjects`:** Tests parsing an array where the items are objects.  This is a common pattern.
> *    **`testProcedure`:** Tests specifically the structure for `xrpcProcedure`, namely that it contains an `input`.
> *   **Comprehensive Type Checks and Casting:** Makes sure that no tests cause errors due to bad types, similar to the previous versions.
> *  **`testParseBlob`:** Test specifically parsing of `{"type": "blob"}`.
> 
> This expanded test suite provides significantly better coverage of the Lexicon specification and the expected behavior of your `LexiconParser`.  It's now in a much better position to guide the implementation of the parser itself.  Remember to keep adding tests as you discover new edge cases or expand functionality. This forms the basis of the test-first TDD model.

> What's the triple quote syntax about? I've never seen that before in a Java string declaration.

#### _Assistant_

> You are absolutely correct to question that! The triple-double-quote syntax (`"""`) is a **text block**, a feature introduced in Java 13 as a preview and finalized in Java 15. It's designed to make multi-line strings much more readable and manageable, *especially* for things like embedded JSON, SQL, or HTML.
> 
> **Key Benefits of Text Blocks:**
> 
> 1.  **No Escape Sequences for Newlines:** You don't need `\n` for newlines.  The newlines in the text block are preserved directly.
> 2.  **No Concatenation:** You don't need `+` operators to join lines.
> 3.  **Automatic Indentation Handling (Incidental Whitespace):** The compiler intelligently strips away *incidental* leading whitespace, making the code look cleaner.  The amount of indentation removed is determined by the *least indented line* within the text block (or the closing delimiter).
> 4. **Escape sequences are reduced:** With regular strings, every special character (`\`) must be typed with two (`\\`). With text blocks, this is no longer needed.
> 
> **How it works:**
> 
> *   **Opening Delimiter:**  `"""` followed *immediately* by a newline. The newline after the opening `"""` is *not* part of the string content.
> *   **Content:**  The string content, including newlines and any indentation you want to *keep*.
> *   **Closing Delimiter:** `"""` on a line by itself. The indentation of the closing `"""` helps determine the common whitespace prefix to be removed.
> 
> **Example (and why it's better than the old way):**
> 
> **Old Way (String Literals):**
> 
> ```java
> String json = "{\n" +
>               "  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n" +
>               "  \"age\": 30,\n" +
>               "  \"city\": \"New York\"\n" +
>               "}";
> String json2 = "{\\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\\n  \"age\": 30,\\n  \"city\": \"New York\"\\n}"; //Another way to use the old way
> ```
> 
> **New Way (Text Blocks):**
> 
> ```java
> String json = """
>     {
>       "name": "John Doe",
>       "age": 30,
>       "city": "New York"
>     }
>     """;
> ```
> 
> Notice how much cleaner and more readable the text block is. It looks *exactly* like the JSON you intend to represent. This is very important when using the `LexiconParser` since it needs to parse JSON. If you have a string declaration error using regular String literals, then you're likely to have problems with the functionality in this project.
> 
> **Key changes in `LexiconParserTest` because of Text Blocks:**
> 
> The main change in `LexiconParserTest.java` is that all those multi-line JSON strings are now *much* easier to read and write, thanks to text blocks.  This makes the tests themselves more maintainable and less prone to errors. The code using `stringToInputStream` is still the same since this will not affect `InputStream` generation.
> 
> **In summary,** text blocks are a significant improvement for Java code that deals with multi-line strings. They make your code more readable, less error-prone, and easier to maintain.  They are a perfect fit for this project, where you're dealing with JSON Lexicon definitions.

#### _Assistant_

> You're observant! That line of code might look a little strange at first, even to someone familiar with Java before records and more modern type inference. Let's break down what's happening, and why it's correct (and necessary):
> 
> ```java
> LexObject inputSchema = (LexObject) input.getSchema().get();
> ```
> 
> Here's a step-by-step explanation:
> 
> 1.  **`input.getSchema()`:**  This part calls a method named `getSchema()` on the `input` object (which is of type `LexXrpcBody`).  Based on previous context, we know that `getSchema()` returns an `Optional<LexiconType>`.  The use of `Optional` indicates that the schema *might* be present, or it *might* be absent (e.g., a procedure that takes no input).
> 
> 2.  **`.get()` (on the Optional):** The `.get()` method is called on the `Optional<LexiconType>` returned by `getSchema()`.  This does two things:
>     *   **Unwraps the value:** If the `Optional` contains a value (a `LexiconType` in this case), `.get()` returns that value.
>     *   **Throws an exception if empty:** If the `Optional` is *empty* (meaning there's no schema), `.get()` throws a `NoSuchElementException`. This is important for correctness.  We're *assuming* the schema exists at this point in the code; if it doesn't, that's an error in the Lexicon definition, and we *want* the test to fail. In a real-world scenario (outside of a test), you'd typically use `Optional.isPresent()` to check *before* calling `.get()`, or use methods like `orElse()`, `orElseThrow()`, or `ifPresent()` to handle the optionality more gracefully.  But within a test, it's often acceptable to let `.get()` throw an exception if the assumption is violated.
> 
> 3.  **`(LexObject) ...` (the cast):** This is a *cast*.  We're telling the compiler, "We know that the value returned by `input.getSchema().get()` is, in fact, a `LexObject`".  This is *necessary* because `getSchema()` is declared to return `Optional<LexiconType>`, and `LexiconType` is a *base* type (likely an abstract class or interface).  `LexObject` is a *subtype* of `LexiconType`.  Java's type system requires an explicit cast when you're going from a more general type (the base type) to a more specific type (the subtype).
> 
> 4.  **`LexObject inputSchema = ...` (the declaration):**  Finally, we declare a variable named `inputSchema` of type `LexObject` and assign the result of the cast to it.
> 
> **Why is the cast necessary?**
> 
> Consider this simplified example:
> 
> ```java
> abstract class Animal {
>     public abstract void makeSound();
> }
> 
> class Dog extends Animal {
>     @Override
>     public void makeSound() {
>         System.out.println("Woof!");
>     }
>     public void fetch() {
>         System.out.println("Fetching...");
>     }
> }
> 
> class Cat extends Animal {
>     @Override
>     public void makeSound() {
>         System.out.println("Meow!");
>     }
> }
> 
> // ... somewhere else ...
> Optional<Animal> maybeAnimal = getAnimalFromSomewhere();  // Returns an Optional<Animal>
> 
> Animal animal = maybeAnimal.get(); // This is fine; we are unwrapping the object to its basic type
> animal.makeSound();  // This is fine; all Animals have makeSound()
> 
> // animal.fetch();  // ERROR!  The compiler doesn't know it's a Dog
> 
> Dog dog = (Dog) animal; // Cast.  We're *telling* the compiler it's a Dog.
> dog.makeSound();    // Fine.
> dog.fetch();        // Fine!
> // Cat cat = (Cat) animal //This would throw an exception at runtime, if animal contains a Dog
> 
> ```
> 
> In the `LexiconParserTest` case, `LexiconType` is like `Animal`, and `LexObject` is like `Dog`.  The `getSchema()` method could return any kind of `LexiconType` (a `LexString`, a `LexInteger`, a `LexArray`, etc.).  We, as the developers of the test, *know* from the structure of the test JSON that in *this particular case*, the schema should be a `LexObject`.  The cast is how we communicate that knowledge to the compiler.
> 
> **Why not declare `inputSchema` as `LexiconType`?**
> 
> We *could* do that:
> 
> ```java
> LexiconType inputSchema = input.getSchema().get();
> ```
> 
> But then we *wouldn't* be able to call any methods specific to `LexObject` on `inputSchema` without casting *later*.  For instance, we want to do this immediately afterward:
> 
> ```java
> LexObject inputSchema = (LexObject) input.getSchema().get();
> LexString message = (LexString)inputSchema.getProperties().get("message");
> ```
> 
> If `inputSchema` were declared as `LexiconType`, we'd have to cast *every time* we wanted to access `LexObject`-specific functionality:
> 
> ```java
> LexiconType inputSchema = input.getSchema().get();
> // These don't work:
> // inputSchema.getProperties()
> // ((LexObject)inputSchema).getProperties()
> 
> LexString message = (LexString)((LexObject)inputSchema).getProperties().get("message"); // Messy! Cast everywhere!
> ```
> 
> By casting *once* up front, we make the rest of the code in that test method cleaner and easier to read. We're essentially saying, "We've checked the type; from now on, we're going to treat this value as a `LexObject`".
> 
> **Runtime Safety:**
> 
> This code *is* runtime-safe, thanks to the surrounding context and, ideally, prior checks using `instanceof`. In the complete `LexiconParserTest`, we have code like this:
> 
> ```java
>     LexXrpcBody schema = query.getOutput().get().getSchema().get();     // Test Optionals along the way
> 
>     LexBytes bytes = (LexBytes) schema;    // Cast is safe, after validation
>     assertEquals("bytes", bytes.getType());
>         }
> ```
> And in other tests:
> ```java
>     LexXrpcParameters params = query.getParameters().get();  // Test Optional existence
>     assertNotNull(params);
>     LexObject props = (LexObject) params; // Validate parameters, is in-fact, an Object
> ```
> 
> So, here we have an `instanceof` test *before* the case. If `schema` were *not* an instance of `LexObject`, then the previous lines would fail. The cast to `(LexObject) inputSchema` is only valid if there is a LexObject returned from that Optional. As you said, the test would throw a `NoSuchElementException`.
> 
> In summary, the cast, combined with the `.get()` on the `Optional`, is a deliberate choice within the context of a *test* to:
> 
> 1.  Assert that the parsed structure is what we expect.
> 2.  Allow us to use the specific methods of `LexObject` without further casting.
> 3.  Cause the test to fail quickly and clearly if our assumptions about the parsed Lexicon are wrong.
> 
> It's a pattern you'll see frequently in test code, but would often be handled more cautiously in production code.

> Do you feel we need any additional tests in LexiconParserTest.java? Or is it complete enough to move on to other files? LexiconParserTest.java 

#### _Assistant_

> Yes, I think we should add a few more test cases to `LexiconParserTest.java` before we move on.  While we have good coverage of individual features, we should add tests that cover:
> 
> 1.  **More complex combinations of features:**  Nesting arrays and objects more deeply, combining refs and unions in realistic ways, etc.  This helps catch subtle bugs in how different parts of the parser interact.
> 2.  **Edge cases around `null` and empty values:**  Lexicons can have optional fields, and we need to make sure the parser handles `null` values correctly (both in the JSON and in the resulting Java objects).
> 3. **Testing `defs` other than `main`.** We are missing that coverage (although some of the other tests *include* other defs, they don't explicitly test using them).
> 4. **Known bad definitions.** We should include tests that use intentionally broken Lexicon definitions to prove we get errors (and what errors we get).
>

> Key Additions and Why:
> 
> *   **`testParseMultipleDefs`:** (Already present, but re-emphasized) Ensures that the parser properly handles Lexicons with multiple definitions in the `defs` map.
> *   **`testParseNestedObjects`:** Checks deeper nesting of objects within objects.  This is *very* common in real-world schemas.
> *   **`testParseArrayOfObjects`:**  Ensures arrays of objects (another very common pattern) are handled correctly.
> *    **`testParseBlob`:** Added explicit test of a `blob` schema.
> *   **`testOptionalProperties`**:  This test verifies that the parser correctly distinguishes between *required* and *optional* properties within an object.  It checks that the `required` array in the Lexicon is correctly interpreted.
> * **`testParseNonMainDef`:** Added test to access a definition *other* than "main."
> * **`testParseWithNullValues`:** Specifically test for potential unexpected `null` values.
> * **`testParseWithEmptyObjectAndArray`:** Specifically handles empty objects `{}` and empty arrays in `"required": []` to prevent errors.
> * **`testKnownBadDefinition_MissingDefs`:** Check for completely missing `defs`.
> * **`testKnownBadDefinition_MissingType`:** Check for missing core "type" declarations.
> * **`testKnownBadDefinition_InvalidRefFormat`:** Check specifically for improperly formatted `ref` strings.
> 
> With these additions, `LexiconParserTest.java` has *excellent* coverage.  It tests a very wide array of valid Lexicon structures, and it also tests important error conditions and edge cases.  You should be in a very good position to start implementing the `LexiconParser` itself.

#### _Assistant_

> You're right to point that out! The comment was incomplete and potentially misleading. It should say:
> 
> > This tests to make sure we don't accidentally throw an error on a valid Lexicon, because there is no "nullable" **field** (or a field indicating nullability).
> 
> Here's the corrected and slightly expanded explanation, along with why the test is important:
> 
> **The Problem:**
> 
> In earlier versions of JSON Schema (which Lexicon is similar to), there was sometimes a `nullable` property you could add to a type definition to explicitly indicate that `null` was an acceptable value.  For example:
> 
> ```json
> {
>   "type": "string",
>   "nullable": true
> }
> ```
> 
> Lexicon *does not* have a `nullable` keyword in this way.  In Lexicon, the absence of a field in the `"required": [...]` array within an object schema implicitly means that the field is *optional*, and therefore, `null` is a perfectly acceptable value. If a property does not exist in the properties of an object, then that's an error. But, if the field is optional, then `null` is permitted.
> 
> **Why the Test is Important:**
> 
> 1.  **Correctness:** The test confirms that the parser correctly implements the Lexicon specification regarding optional fields and `null` values.  A naive implementation might mistakenly treat all fields as required, or might incorrectly try to look for a `nullable` property.
> 2.  **Completeness** It is important to make sure that if a field is not present in the main schema definition, and it also not listed in any `required` section, that the parser does not throw an error.
> 3.  **Regression Prevention:** As the parser evolves, this test helps prevent regressions.  Someone might accidentally introduce a change that breaks the handling of optional fields, and this test would catch that.
> 
> **How the Test Works (Recap with Nulls):**

> ```
> The important points:
> * In `parameters:`: We've declared that  `"optionalString": { "type": "string" }`. Since it's not required, no error will appear.
> * In `output/schema`: the section `required": []` array is *empty*.  This means that *neither* `nullableProp` *nor* `anotherNullableProp` are required to be present in an *instance* of this schema.  If a JSON object conforming to this schema were to be parsed, the parser *would not* throw an error if those properties were missing (or set to `null`).
> 
> The test is *not* explicitly putting `null` values *into* the Lexicon definition itself.  Instead, it's testing the parser's handling of *optionality*, which in turn determines how `null` values are handled *when processing data that conforms to the generated schema*. We aren't processing records in these tests yet. Right now, everything is using static sample data -- *not* processing runtime data.
> 
> So the original comment was incomplete. It wasn't testing that the `"nullable"` *keyword* was absent (it should never be present).  It was testing that the code generated by the Lexicon parser, given this Lexicon file with optional parts, wouldn't cause an error.

> > **This library is a Bluesky/ATProtocol client library compatible with [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html).**It depends on [khttpclient](https://github.com/uakihir0/khttpclient) and uses Ktor Client internally. Therefore, this library can be used on any platform supported by Kotlin Multiplatform and Ktor Client. The behavior on each platform depends on [khttpclient](https://github.com/uakihir0/khttpclient).
> > 
> > ## Usage
> > 
> > [](#usage)
> > 
> > Below is how to use it with Kotlin on the supported platforms using Gradle.  
> > **If you are using it on an Apple platform, please refer to [kbsky-cocoapods](https://github.com/uakihir0/kbsky-cocoapods).**  
> > Additionally, please check the test code as well.

>  What is a POM ? 
>  A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It contains default values for most projects. Examples for this is the build directory, which is target ; the source directory, which is src/main/java ; the test source directory, which is src/test/java ; and so on. When executing a task or goal, Maven looks for the POM in the current directory. It reads the POM, gets the needed configuration information, then executes the goal. 
>  Some of the configuration that can be specified in the POM are the project dependencies, the plugins or goals that can be executed, the build profiles, and so on. Other information such as the project version, description, developers, mailing lists and such can also be specified. 
>  [top] 
>  Super POM 
>  The Super POM is Maven's default POM. All POMs extend the Super POM unless explicitly set, meaning the configuration specified in the Super POM is inherited by the POMs you created for your projects. 
>  You can see the Super POM for the latest Maven 3 release in Maven Core reference documentation. 
>  [top] 
>  Minimal POM 
>  The minimum requirement for a POM are the following: 
>  
>  project root 
>  modelVersion - should be set to 4.0.0 
>  groupId - the id of the project's group. 
>  artifactId - the id of the artifact (project) 
>  version - the version of the artifact under the specified group 
>  Here's an example: 
>  &lt;project&gt;
> &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  A POM requires that its groupId, artifactId, and version be configured. These three values form the project's fully qualified artifact name. This is in the form of &lt;groupId&gt;:&lt;artifactId&gt;:&lt;version&gt;. As for the example above, its fully qualified artifact name is "com.mycompany.app:my-app:1". 
>  Also, as mentioned in the first section , if the configuration details are not specified, Maven will use their defaults. One of these default values is the packaging type. Every Maven project has a packaging type. If it is not specified in the POM, then the default value "jar" would be used. 
>  Furthermore, you can see that in the minimal POM the repositories were not specified. If you build your project using the minimal POM, it would inherit the repositories configuration in the Super POM. Therefore when Maven sees the dependencies in the minimal POM, it would know that these dependencies will be downloaded from https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2 which was specified in the Super POM. 
>  [top] 
>  Project Inheritance 
>  Elements in the POM that are merged are the following: 
>  
>  dependencies 
>  developers and contributors 
>  plugin lists (including reports) 
>  plugin executions with matching ids 
>  plugin configuration 
>  resources 
>  The Super POM is one example of project inheritance, however you can also introduce your own parent POMs by specifying the parent element in the POM, as demonstrated in the following examples. 
>  Example 1 
>  The Scenario 
>  As an example, let us reuse our previous artifact, com.mycompany.app:my-app:1. And let us introduce another artifact, com.mycompany.app:my-module:1. 
>  &lt;project&gt;
> &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;

>  Project Aggregation is similar to Project Inheritance . But instead of specifying the parent POM from the module, it specifies the modules from the parent POM. By doing so, the parent project now knows its modules, and if a Maven command is invoked against the parent project, that Maven command will then be executed to the parent's modules as well. To do Project Aggregation, you must do the following:

For the packaging, its value was set to "pom", and for the modules section, we have the element &lt;module&gt;my-module&lt;/module&gt; . The value of &lt;module&gt; is the relative path from the com.mycompany.app:my-app:1 to com.mycompany.app:my-module:1's POM ( by practice, we use the module's artifactId as the module directory's name ).

>  Project Inheritance vs Project Aggregation 
>  If you have several Maven projects, and they all have similar configurations, you can refactor your projects by pulling out those similar configurations and making a parent project. Thus, all you have to do is to let your Maven projects inherit that parent project, and those configurations would then be applied to all of them.

>  Project Interpolation and Variables 
>  One of the practices that Maven encourages is don't repeat yourself . However, there are circumstances where you will need to use the same value in several different locations. To assist in ensuring the value is only specified once, Maven allows you to use both your own and pre-defined variables in the POM. 
>  For example, to access the project.version variable, you would reference it like so: 
>  &lt;version&gt;${project.version}&lt;/version&gt; 
>  One factor to note is that these variables are processed after inheritance as outlined above. This means that if a parent project uses a variable, then its definition in the child, not the parent, will be the one eventually used. 
>  Available Variables 
>  Project Model Variables 
>  Any field of the model that is a single value element can be referenced as a variable. For example, ${project.groupId} , ${project.version} , ${project.build.sourceDirectory} and so on. Refer to the POM reference to see a full list of properties. 
>  These variables are all referenced by the prefix " project. ". You may also see references with pom. as the prefix, or the prefix omitted entirely - these forms are now deprecated and should not be used.

>  What is the POM? 
>  POM stands for "Project Object Model". It is an XML representation of a Maven project held in a file named pom.xml . When in the presence of Maven folks, speaking of a project is speaking in the philosophical sense, beyond a mere collection of files containing code. A project contains configuration files, as well as the developers involved and the roles they play, the defect tracking system, the organization and licenses, the URL of where the project lives, the project's dependencies, and all of the other little pieces that come into play to give code life. It is a one-stop-shop for all things concerning the project. In fact, in the Maven world, a project does not need to contain any code at all, merely a pom.xml . 
>  Quick Overview 
>  This is a listing of the elements directly under the POM's project element. Notice that modelVersion contains 4.0.0. That is currently the only supported POM version, and is always required.

>  The Basics 
>  The POM contains all necessary information about a project, as well as configurations of plugins to be used during the build process. It is the declarative manifestation of the "who", "what", and "where", while the build lifecycle is the "when" and "how". That is not to say that the POM cannot affect the flow of the lifecycle - it can. For example, by configuring the maven-antrun-plugin , one can embed Apache Ant tasks inside of the POM. It is ultimately a declaration, however. Whereas a build.xml tells Ant precisely what to do when it is run (procedural), a POM states its configuration (declarative). If some external force causes the lifecycle to skip the Ant plugin execution, it does not stop the plugins that are executed from doing their magic. This is unlike a build.xml file, where tasks are almost always dependant on the lines executed before it.

> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  Maven Coordinates 
>  The POM defined above is the bare minimum that Maven allows. groupId:artifactId:version are all required fields (although, groupId and version do not need to be explicitly defined if they are inherited from a parent - more on inheritance later). The three fields act much like an address and timestamp in one. This marks a specific place in a repository, acting like a coordinate system for Maven projects: 
>  
>  groupId : This is generally unique amongst an organization or a project. For example, all core Maven artifacts do (well, should) live under the groupId org.apache.maven . Group ID's do not necessarily use the dot notation, for example, the junit project. Note that the dot-notated groupId does not have to correspond to the package structure that the project contains. It is, however, a good practice to follow. When stored within a repository, the group acts much like the Java packaging structure does in an operating system. The dots are replaced by OS specific directory separators (such as '/' in Unix) which becomes a relative directory structure from the base repository. In the example given, the org.codehaus.mojo group lives within the directory $M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo . 
>  artifactId : The artifactId is generally the name that the project is known by. Although the groupId is important, people within the group will rarely mention the groupId in discussion (they are often all be the same ID, such as the MojoHaus project groupId: org.codehaus.mojo ). It, along with the groupId, creates a key that separates this project from every other project in the world (at least, it should :) ). Along with the groupId, the artifactId fully defines the artifact's living quarters within the repository. In the case of the above project, my-project lives in $M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo/my-project . 
>  version : This is the last piece of the naming puzzle. groupId:artifactId denotes a single project but they cannot delineate which incarnation of that project we are talking about. Do we want the junit:junit of 2018 (version 4.12), or of 2007 (version 3.8.2)? In short: code changes, those changes should be versioned, and this element keeps those versions in line. It is also used within an artifact's repository to separate versions from each other. my-project version 1.0 files live in the directory structure $M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo/my-project/1.0 . 
>  The three elements given above point to a specific version of a project, letting Maven know who we are dealing with, and when in its software lifecycle we want them. 
>  Packaging 
>  Now that we have our address structure of groupId:artifactId:version , there is one more standard label to give us a really complete what : that is the project's packaging. In our case, the example POM for org.codehaus.mojo:my-project:1.0 defined above will be packaged as a jar . We could make it into a war by declaring a different packaging: 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> ...
> &lt;packaging&gt;war&lt;/packaging&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  When no packaging is declared, Maven assumes the packaging is the default: jar . The valid types are Plexus role-hints (read more on Plexus for a explanation of roles and role-hints) of the component role org.apache.maven.lifecycle.mapping.LifecycleMapping . The current core packaging values are: pom , jar , maven-plugin , ejb , war , ear , rar . These define the default list of goals which execute on each corresponding build lifecycle stage for a particular package structure: see Plugin Bindings for default Lifecycle Reference for details. 
>  POM Relationships 
>  One powerful aspect of Maven is its handling of project relationships: this includes dependencies (and transitive dependencies), inheritance, and aggregation (multi-module projects). 
>  Dependency management has a long tradition of being a complicated mess for anything but the most trivial of projects. "Jarmageddon" quickly ensues as the dependency tree becomes large and complicated. "Jar Hell" follows, where versions of dependencies on one system are not equivalent to the versions developed with, either by the wrong version given, or conflicting versions between similarly named jars. 
>  Maven solves both problems through a common local repository from which to link projects correctly, versions and all. 
>  Dependencies 
>  The cornerstone of the POM is its dependency list. Most projects depend on others to build and run correctly. If all Maven does for you is manage this list, you have gained a lot. Maven downloads and links the dependencies on compilation, as well as on other goals that require them. As an added bonus, Maven brings in the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies), allowing your list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.

>  groupId , artifactId , version : You will see these elements often. This trinity is used to compute the Maven coordinate of a specific project in time, demarcating it as a dependency of this project. The purpose of this computation is to select a version that matches all the dependency declarations (due to transitive dependencies, there can be multiple dependency declarations for the same artifact). The values should be:
>  
>  groupId , artifactId : directly the corresponding coordinates of the dependency, 
>  version : a dependency version requirement specification , that is used to compute the dependency's effective version. 
>  Since the dependency is described by Maven coordinates, you may be thinking: "This means that my project can only depend upon Maven artifacts!" The answer is, "Of course, but that's a good thing." This forces you to depend solely on dependencies that Maven can manage. 
>  There are times, unfortunately, when a project cannot be downloaded from the central Maven repository. For example, a project may depend upon a jar that has a closed-source license which prevents it from being in a central repository. There are three methods for dealing with this scenario. 
>  
>  Install the dependency locally using the install plugin. The method is the simplest recommended method. For example:
>  
>  mvn install:install-file -Dfile=non-maven-proj.jar -DgroupId=some.group -DartifactId=non-maven-proj -Dversion=1 -Dpackaging=jar 
>  Notice that an address is still required, only this time you use the command line and the install plugin will create a POM for you with the given address. 
>  Create your own repository and deploy it there. This is a favorite method for companies with an intranet and need to be able to keep everyone in synch. There is a Maven goal called deploy:deploy-file which is similar to the install:install-file goal (read the plugin's goal page for more information). 
>  Set the dependency scope to system and define a systemPath . This is not recommended, however, but leads us to explaining the following elements: 
>  classifier : The classifier distinguishes artifacts that were built from the same POM but differ in content. It is some optional and arbitrary string that - if present - is appended to the artifact name just after the version number.
>  As a motivation for this element, consider for example a project that offers an artifact targeting Java 11 but at the same time also an artifact that still supports Java 1.8. The first artifact could be equipped with the classifier jdk11 and the second one with jdk8 such that clients can choose which one to use. 
>  Another common use case for classifiers is to attach secondary artifacts to the project's main artifact. If you browse the Maven central repository, you will notice that the classifiers sources and javadoc are used to deploy the project source code and API docs along with the packaged class files. 
>  type : Corresponds to the chosen dependency type. This defaults to jar . While it usually represents the extension on the filename of the dependency, that is not always the case: a type can be mapped to a different extension and a classifier. The type often corresponds to the packaging used, though this is also not always the case. Some examples are jar , ejb-client and test-jar : see default artifact handlers for a list. New types can be defined by plugins that set extensions to true, so this is not a complete list. 
>  scope : This element refers to the classpath of the task at hand (compiling and runtime, testing, etc.) as well as how to limit the transitivity of a dependency. There are five scopes available:

>  compile - this is the default scope, used if none is specified. Compile dependencies are available in all classpaths. Furthermore, those dependencies are propagated to dependent projects. 
>  provided - this is much like compile, but indicates you expect the JDK or a container to provide it at runtime. It is only available on the compilation and test classpath, and is not transitive. 
>  runtime - this scope indicates that the dependency is not required for compilation, but is for execution. It is in the runtime and test classpaths, but not the compile classpath. 
>  test - this scope indicates that the dependency is not required for normal use of the application, and is only available for the test compilation and execution phases. It is not transitive. 
>  system - this scope is similar to provided except that you have to provide the JAR which contains it explicitly. The artifact is always available and is not looked up in a repository. 
>  systemPath : is used only if the dependency scope is system . Otherwise, the build will fail if this element is set. The path must be absolute, so it is recommended to use a property to specify the machine-specific path (more on properties below), such as ${java.home}/lib . Since it is assumed that system scope dependencies are installed a priori , Maven does not check the repositories for the project, but instead checks to ensure that the file exists. If not, Maven fails the build and suggests that you download and install it manually. 
>  optional : Marks a dependency optional when this project itself is a dependency. For example, imagine a project A that depends upon project B to compile a portion of code that may not be used at runtime, then we may have no need for project B for all project. So if project X adds project A as its own dependency, then Maven does not need to install project B at all. Symbolically, if =&gt; represents a required dependency, and --&gt; represents optional, although A=&gt;B may be the case when building A X=&gt;A--&gt;B would be the case when building X .
>  In the shortest terms, optional lets other projects know that, when you use this project, you do not require this dependency in order to work correctly. 
>  Dependency Management 
>  Dependencies can be managed in the dependencyManagement section to affect the resolution of dependencies which are not fully qualified or to enforce the usage of a specific transitive dependency version. Further information in Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism . 
>  Dependency Version Requirement Specification 
>  Dependencies' version elements define version requirements, which are used to compute dependency versions. Soft requirements can be replaced by different versions of the same artifact found elsewhere in the dependency graph. Hard requirements mandate a particular version or versions and override soft requirements. If there are no versions of a dependency that satisfy all the hard requirements for that artifact, the build fails. 
>  Version requirements have the following syntax: 
>  
>  1.0 : Soft requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 if no other version appears earlier in the dependency tree. 
>  [1.0] : Hard requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 and only 1.0. 
>  (,1.0] : Hard requirement for any version &lt;= 1.0. 
>  [1.2,1.3] : Hard requirement for any version between 1.2 and 1.3 inclusive. 
>  [1.0,2.0) : 1.0 &lt;= x &lt; 2.0; Hard requirement for any version between 1.0 inclusive and 2.0 exclusive. 
>  [1.5,) : Hard requirement for any version greater than or equal to 1.5. 
>  (,1.0],[1.2,) : Hard requirement for any version less than or equal to 1.0 than or greater than or equal to 1.2, but not 1.1. Multiple requirements are separated by commas. 
>  (,1.1),(1.1,) : Hard requirement for any version except 1.1; for example because 1.1 has a critical vulnerability.
>  Maven picks the highest version of each project that satisfies all the hard requirements of the dependencies on that project. If no version satisfies all the hard requirements, the build fails. 
>  Version Order Specification : 
>  If version strings are syntactically correct Semantic Versioning 1.0.0 version numbers, then in almost all cases version comparison follows the precedence rules outlined in that specification. These versions are the commonly encountered alphanumeric ASCII strings such as 2.15.2-alpha. More precisely, this is true if both version numbers to be compared match the "valid semver" production in the BNF grammar in the semantic versioning specification. Maven does not consider any semantics implied by that specification. 
>  Important : This is only true for Semantic Versioning 1.0.0 . The Maven version order algorithm is not compatible with Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 . In particular, Maven does not special case the plus sign or consider build identifiers. 
>  When version strings do not follow semantic versioning, a more complex set of rules is required. The Maven coordinate is split in tokens between dots (' . '), hyphens (' - '), underscore (' _ ') and transitions between digits and characters. The separator is recorded and will have effect on the order. A transition between digits and characters is equivalent to a hyphen. Empty tokens are replaced with " 0 ". This gives a sequence of version numbers (numeric tokens) and version qualifiers (non-numeric tokens) with " . " or " - " prefixes. Versions are expected to start with numbers. 
>  Splitting and Replacing Examples: 
>  
>  1-1.foo-bar1baz-.1 -&gt; 1-1.foo-bar-1-baz-0.1 
>  Then, starting from the end of the version, the trailing "null" values ( 0 , "" , " final ", " ga ") are trimmed. This process is repeated at each remaining hyphen from end to start. 
>  Trimming Examples: 
>  
>  1.0.0 -&gt; 1 
>  1.ga -&gt; 1 
>  1.final -&gt; 1 
>  1.0 -&gt; 1 
>  1. -&gt; 1 
>  1- -&gt; 1 
>  1.0.0-foo.0.0 -&gt; 1-foo 
>  1.0.0-0.0.0 -&gt; 1 
>  The version order is the lexicographical order on this sequence of prefixed tokens, the shorter one padded with enough "null" values with matching prefix to have the same length as the longer one. Padded "null" values depend on the prefix of the other version: 0 for '.', "" for '-'. The prefixed token order is: 
>  
>  if the prefix is the same, then compare the token:
>  
>  Numeric tokens have the natural order. 
>  Non-numeric tokens ("qualifiers") have the alphabetical order, except for the following tokens which come first in this order:
>  " alpha " &lt; " beta " &lt; " milestone " &lt; " rc " = " cr " &lt; " snapshot " &lt; "" = " final " = " ga " &lt; " sp " 
>  
>  the " alpha ", " beta " and " milestone " qualifiers can respectively be shortened to "a", "b" and "m" when directly followed by a number. 
>  else " .qualifier " = " -qualifier " &lt; " -number " &lt; " .number " 
>  alpha = a &lt;&lt;&lt;beta &gt;&gt; = b &lt;&lt;&lt;milestone &gt;&gt; = m &lt;&lt;&lt;rc &gt;&gt; = cr &lt;&lt;&lt;snapshot &gt;&gt; '&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;' = final = ga = release &lt; sp 
>  Following semver rules is encouraged, and some qualifiers are discouraged: 
>  
>  Prefer ' alpha ', ' beta ', and ' milestone ' qualifiers over ' ea ' and ' preview '. 
>  Prefer ' 1.0.0-RC1 '' over ' 1.0.0.RC1 '. 
>  The usage of ' CR ' qualifier is discouraged. Use ' RC ' instead. 
>  The usage of ' final ', ' ga ', and ' release ' qualifiers is discouraged. Use no qualifier instead. 
>  The usage of ' SP ' qualifier is discouraged. Increment the patch version instead. 
>  End Result Examples: 
>  
>  " 1 " &lt; " 1.1 " (number padding) 
>  " 1-snapshot " &lt; " 1 " &lt; " 1-sp " (qualifier padding) 
>  " 1-foo2 " &lt; " 1-foo10 " (correctly automatically "switching" to numeric order) 
>  " 1.foo " = " 1-foo " &lt; " 1-1 " = " 1.1 " 
>  " 1.ga " = " 1-ga " = " 1-0 " = " 1.0 " = " 1 " (removing of trailing "null" values) 
>  " 1-sp " &gt; " 1-ga " 
>  " 1-sp.1 " &gt; " 1-ga.1 " 
>  " 1-sp-1 " &gt; " 1-ga-1 " 
>  " 1-a1 " = " 1-alpha-1 "
>  Note: Contrary to what was stated in some design documents, for version order, snapshots are not treated differently than releases or any other qualifier. 
>  Note: As 2.0-rc1 &lt; 2.0 , the version requirement [1.0,2.0) excludes 2.0 but includes version 2.0-rc1 , which is contrary to what most people expect. In addition, Gradle interprets it differently, resulting in different dependency trees for the same POM. If the intention is to restrict it to 1.* versions, the better version requirement is [1,1.999999) . 
>  Version Order Testing : 
>  The maven distribution includes a tool to check version order. It was used to produce the examples in the previous paragraphs. Feel free to run it yourself when in doubt. You can run it like this: 
>  
>  java -jar ${MAVEN_HOME}/lib/maven-artifact-3.9.7.jar [versions...] 
>  example: 
>  
>  $ java -jar ./lib/maven-artifact-3.9.7.jar 1 2 1.1
> Display parameters as parsed by Maven (in canonical form and as a list of tokens) and comparison result:
> 1. 1 -&gt; 1; tokens: [1]
> 1 &lt; 2
> 2. 2 -&gt; 2; tokens: [2]
> 2 &gt; 1.1
> 3. 1.1 -&gt; 1.1; tokens: [1, 1] 
>  Exclusions 
>  It is sometimes useful to limit a dependency's transitive dependencies. A dependency may have incorrectly specified scopes, or dependencies that conflict with other dependencies in your project. Exclusions tell Maven not to include a specified artifact in the classpath even if it is a dependency of one or more of this project's dependencies (a transitive dependency). For example, maven-embedder depends on maven-core . Suppose you want to depend on maven-embedder but do not want to include maven-core or its dependencies in the classpath. Then add maven-core as an exclusion in the element that declares the dependency on maven-embedder: 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> ...
> &lt;dependencies&gt;
> &lt;dependency&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-embedder&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;3.9.7&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;exclusions&gt;
> &lt;exclusion&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;/exclusion&gt;
> &lt;/exclusions&gt;
> &lt;/dependency&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/dependencies&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  This only removes the path to maven-core from this one dependency. If maven-core appears as a direct or transitive dependency elsewhere in the POM, it can still be added to the classpath. 
>  Wildcard excludes make it easy to exclude all of a dependency's transitive dependencies. In the case below, you may be working with the maven-embedder and you want to manage the dependencies you use, so you exclude all the transitive dependencies: 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> ...
> &lt;dependencies&gt;
> &lt;dependency&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-embedder&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;3.8.6&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;exclusions&gt;
> &lt;exclusion&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;*&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;*&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;/exclusion&gt;
> &lt;/exclusions&gt;
> &lt;/dependency&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/dependencies&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  
>  exclusions : Exclusions contain one or more exclusion elements, each containing a groupId and artifactId denoting a dependency to exclude. Unlike optional , which may or may not be installed and used, exclusions actively remove artifacts from the dependency tree. 
>  Inheritance 
>  One powerful addition that Maven brings to build management is the concept of project inheritance. Although in build systems such as Ant inheritance can be simulated, Maven makes project inheritance explicit in the project object model. 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;

> &lt;version&gt;2.0&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;packaging&gt;pom&lt;/packaging&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  The packaging type is required to be pom for parent and aggregation (multi-module) projects. These types define the goals bound to a set of lifecycle stages. For example, if packaging is jar , then the package phase will execute the jar:jar goal. Now we may add values to the parent POM, which will be inherited by its children. Most elements from the parent POM are inherited by its children, including: 
>  
>  groupId 
>  version 
>  description 
>  url 
>  inceptionYear 
>  organization 
>  licenses

> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-project&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  Notice the relativePath element. It is not required, but may be used as a signifier to Maven to first search the path given for this project's parent, before searching the local and then remote repositories. 
>  To see inheritance in action, just have a look at the ASF or Maven parent POM's. 
>  Detailed inheritance rules are outlined in Maven Model Builder . All URLs are transformed when being inherited by default. The other ones are just inherited as is. For plugin configuration you can overwrite the inheritance behaviour with the attributes combine.children or combine.self outlined in Plugins . 
>  The Super POM 
>  Similar to the inheritance of objects in object oriented programming, POMs that extend a parent POM inherit certain values from that parent. Moreover, just as Java objects ultimately inherit from java.lang.Object , all Project Object Models inherit from a base Super POM. The snippet below is the Super POM for Maven 3.5.4.

>  You can take a look at how the Super POM affects your Project Object Model by creating a minimal pom.xml and executing on the command line: mvn help:effective-pom 
>  Dependency Management 
>  Besides inheriting certain top-level elements, parents have elements to configure values for child POMs and transitive dependencies. One of those elements is dependencyManagement . 
>  
>  dependencyManagement : is used by a POM to help manage dependency information across all of its children. If the my-parent project uses dependencyManagement to define a dependency on junit:junit:4.12 , then POMs inheriting from this one can set their dependency giving the groupId = junit and artifactId = junit only and Maven will fill in the version set by the parent. The benefits of this method are obvious. Dependency details can be set in one central location, which propagates to all inheriting POMs.
>  Note that the version and scope of artifacts which are incorporated from transitive dependencies are also controlled by version specifications in a dependency management section. This can lead to unexpected consequences. Consider a case in which your project uses two dependences, dep1 and dep2 . dep2 in turn also uses dep1 , and requires a particular minimum version to function. If you then use dependencyManagement to specify an older version, dep2 will be forced to use the older version, and fail. So, you must be careful to check the entire dependency tree to avoid this problem; mvn dependency:tree is helpful. 
>  Aggregation (or Multi-Module) 
>  A project with modules is known as a multi-module, or aggregator project. Modules are projects that this POM lists, and are executed as a group. A pom packaged project may aggregate the build of a set of projects by listing them as modules, which are relative paths to the directories or the POM files of those projects.

> &lt;module&gt;third-project/pom-example.xml&lt;/module&gt;
> &lt;/modules&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  You do not need to consider the inter-module dependencies yourself when listing the modules; i.e. the ordering of the modules given by the POM is not important. Maven will topologically sort the modules such that dependencies are always build before dependent modules. 
>  To see aggregation in action, have a look at the Maven base POM. 
>  A final note on Inheritance v. Aggregation 
>  Inheritance and aggregation create a nice dynamic to control builds through a single, high-level POM. You often see projects that are both parents and aggregators. For example, the entire Maven core runs through a single base POM org.apache.maven:maven , so building the Maven project can be executed by a single command: mvn compile . However, an aggregator project and a parent project are both POM projects, they are not one and the same and should not be confused. A POM project may be inherited from - but does not necessarily have - any modules that it aggregates. Conversely, a POM project may aggregate projects that do not inherit from it. 
>  Properties 
>  Properties are the last required piece to understand POM basics. Maven properties are value placeholders, like properties in Ant. Their values are accessible anywhere within a POM by using the notation ${X} , where X is the property. Or they can be used by plugins as default values, for example: 
>  &lt;project&gt;
> ...
> &lt;properties&gt;
> &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;1.7&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;
> &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;1.7&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;
> &lt;!-- Following project.-properties are reserved for Maven in will become elements in a future POM definition. --&gt;
> &lt;!-- Don't start your own properties properties with project. --&gt;
> &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;
> &lt;project.reporting.outputEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.reporting.outputEncoding&gt;
> &lt;/properties&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  They come in five different styles: 
>  
>  env.X : Prefixing a variable with "env." will return the shell's environment variable. For example, ${env.PATH} contains the PATH environment variable.
>  Note: While environment variables themselves are case-insensitive on Windows, lookup of properties is case-sensitive. In other words, while the Windows shell returns the same value for %PATH% and %Path% , Maven distinguishes between ${env.PATH} and ${env.Path} . The names of environment variables are normalized to all upper-case for the sake of reliability. 
>  project.x : A dot (.) notated path in the POM will contain the corresponding element's value. For example: &lt;project&gt;&lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;&lt;/project&gt; is accessible via ${project.version} . 
>  settings.x : A dot (.) notated path in the settings.xml will contain the corresponding element's value. For example: &lt;settings&gt;&lt;offline&gt;false&lt;/offline&gt;&lt;/settings&gt; is accessible via ${settings.offline} . 
>  Java System Properties: All properties accessible via java.lang.System.getProperties() are available as POM properties, such as ${java.home} . 
>  x : Set within a &lt;properties /&gt; element in the POM. The value of &lt;properties&gt;&lt;someVar&gt;value&lt;/someVar&gt;&lt;/properties&gt; may be used as ${someVar} . 
>  Build Settings 
>  Beyond the basics of the POM given above, there are two more elements that must be understood before claiming basic competency of the POM. They are the build element, that handles things like declaring your project's directory structure and managing plugins; and the reporting element, that largely mirrors the build element for reporting purposes. 
>  Build 
>  According to the POM 4.0.0 XSD, the build element is conceptually divided into two parts: there is a BaseBuild type which contains the set of elements common to both build elements (the top-level build element under project and the build element under profiles , covered below); and there is the Build type, which contains the BaseBuild set as well as more elements for the top level definition. Let us begin with an analysis of the common elements between the two. 
>  Note: These different build elements may be denoted "project build" and "profile build". 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> ...
> &lt;!-- "Project Build" contains more elements than just the BaseBuild set --&gt;
> &lt;build&gt;...&lt;/build&gt;
> &lt;profiles&gt;
> &lt;profile&gt;
> &lt;!-- "Profile Build" contains a subset of "Project Build"s elements --&gt;
> &lt;build&gt;...&lt;/build&gt;
> &lt;/profile&gt;
> &lt;/profiles&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  The BaseBuild Element Set 
>  BaseBuild is exactly as it sounds: the base set of elements between the two build elements in the POM.

>  &lt;build&gt;
> &lt;defaultGoal&gt;install&lt;/defaultGoal&gt;
> &lt;directory&gt;/home/jenkins/82467a7c/workspace/aven_maven-box_maven-site_master/target&lt;/directory&gt;
> &lt;finalName&gt;${artifactId}-${version}&lt;/finalName&gt;
> &lt;filters&gt;
> &lt;filter&gt;filters/filter1.properties&lt;/filter&gt;
> &lt;/filters&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/build&gt; 
>  
>  defaultGoal : the default goal or phase to execute if none is given. If a goal is given, it should be defined as it is in the command line (such as jar:jar ). The same goes for if a phase is defined (such as install). 
>  directory : This is the directory where the build will dump its files or, in Maven parlance, the build's target. It aptly defaults to ${project.basedir}/target . 
>  finalName : This is the name of the bundled project when it is finally built (sans the file extension, for example: my-project-1.0.jar ). It defaults to ${artifactId}-${version} . The term "finalName" is kind of a misnomer, however, as plugins that build the bundled project have every right to ignore/modify this name (but they usually do not). For example, if the maven-jar-plugin is configured to give a jar a classifier of test , then the actual jar defined above will be built as my-project-1.0-test.jar . 
>  filter : Defines *.properties files that contain a list of properties that apply to resources which accept their settings (covered below). In other words, the " name=value " pairs defined within the filter files replace ${name} strings within resources on build. The example above defines the filter1.properties file under the filters/ directory. Maven's default filter directory is ${project.basedir}/src/main/filters/ .
>  For a more comprehensive look at what filters are and what they can do, take a look at the quick start guide . 
>  Resources 
>  Another feature of build elements is specifying where resources exist within your project. Resources are not (usually) code. They are not compiled, but are items meant to be bundled within your project or used for various other reasons, such as code generation. 
>  For example, a Plexus project requires a configuration.xml file (which specifies component configurations to the container) to live within the META-INF/plexus directory. Although we could just as easily place this file within src/main/resources/META-INF/plexus , we want instead to give Plexus its own directory of src/main/plexus . In order for the JAR plugin to bundle the resource correctly, you would specify resources similar to the following: 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> &lt;build&gt;
> ...
> &lt;resources&gt;
> &lt;resource&gt;
> &lt;targetPath&gt;META-INF/plexus&lt;/targetPath&gt;
> &lt;filtering&gt;false&lt;/filtering&gt;
> &lt;directory&gt;/home/jenkins/82467a7c/workspace/aven_maven-box_maven-site_master/src/main/plexus&lt;/directory&gt;
> &lt;includes&gt;
> &lt;include&gt;configuration.xml&lt;/include&gt;
> &lt;/includes&gt;
> &lt;excludes&gt;
> &lt;exclude&gt;**/*.properties&lt;/exclude&gt;
> &lt;/excludes&gt;
> &lt;/resource&gt;
> &lt;/resources&gt;
> &lt;testResources&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/testResources&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/build&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  
>  resources : is a list of resource elements that each describe what and where to include files associated with this project. 
>  targetPath : Specifies the directory structure to place the set of resources from a build. Target path defaults to the base directory. A commonly specified target path for resources that will be packaged in a JAR is META-INF. 
>  filtering : is true or false , denoting if filtering is to be enabled for this resource. Note, that filter *.properties files do not have to be defined for filtering to occur - resources can also use properties that are by default defined in the POM (such as ${project.version}), passed into the command line using the "-D" flag (for example, " -Dname = value ") or are explicitly defined by the properties element. Filter files were covered above. 
>  directory : This element's value defines where the resources are to be found. The default directory for a build is ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources . 
>  includes : A set of files patterns which specify the files to include as resources under that specified directory, using * as a wildcard. 
>  excludes : The same structure as includes , but specifies which files to ignore. In conflicts between include and exclude , exclude wins. 
>  testResources : The testResources element block contains testResource elements. Their definitions are similar to resource elements, but are naturally used during test phases. The one difference is that the default (Super POM defined) test resource directory for a project is ${project.basedir}/src/test/resources . Test resources are not deployed. 
>  Plugins 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> &lt;build&gt;
> ...
> &lt;plugins&gt;
> &lt;plugin&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;2.6&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;extensions&gt;false&lt;/extensions&gt;

> &lt;/plugin&gt;
> &lt;/plugins&gt;
> &lt;/build&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  Beyond the standard coordinate of groupId:artifactId:version , there are elements which configure the plugin or this builds interaction with it. 
>  
>  extensions : true or false , whether or not to load extensions of this plugin. It is by default false. Extensions are covered later in this document. 
>  inherited : true or false , whether or not this plugin configuration should apply to POMs which inherit from this one. Default value is true . 
>  configuration : This is specific to the individual plugin. Without going too in depth into the mechanics of how plugins work, suffice it to say that whatever properties that the plugin Mojo may expect (these are getters and setters in the Java Mojo bean) can be specified here. In the above example, we are setting the classifier property to test in the maven-jar-plugin 's Mojo. It may be good to note that all configuration elements, wherever they are within the POM, are intended to pass values to another underlying system, such as a plugin. In other words: values within a configuration element are never explicitly required by the POM schema, but a plugin goal has every right to require configuration values.
>  If your POM declares a parent, it inherits plugin configuration from either the build/plugins or pluginManagement sections of the parent. 
>  
>  default configuration inheritance :
>  To illustrate, consider the following fragment from a parent POM: 
>  &lt;plugin&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;my.group&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;configuration&gt;
> &lt;items&gt;
> &lt;item&gt;parent-1&lt;/item&gt;
> &lt;item&gt;parent-2&lt;/item&gt;
> &lt;/items&gt;
> &lt;properties&gt;
> &lt;parentKey&gt;parent&lt;/parentKey&gt;
> &lt;/properties&gt;
> &lt;/configuration&gt;
> &lt;/plugin&gt; 
>  And consider the following plugin configuration from a project that uses that parent as its parent: 
>  &lt;plugin&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;my.group&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;configuration&gt;
> &lt;items&gt;
> &lt;item&gt;child-1&lt;/item&gt;
> &lt;/items&gt;
> &lt;properties&gt;
> &lt;childKey&gt;child&lt;/childKey&gt;
> &lt;/properties&gt;
> &lt;/configuration&gt;
> &lt;/plugin&gt; 
>  The default behavior is to merge the content of the configuration element according to element name. If the child POM has a particular element, that value becomes the effective value. if the child POM does not have an element, but the parent does, the parent value becomes the effective value. Note that this is purely an operation on XML; no code or configuration of the plugin itself is involved. Only the elements, not their values, are involved. 
>  Applying those rules to the example, Maven comes up with: 
>  &lt;plugin&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;my.group&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;configuration&gt;
> &lt;items&gt;
> &lt;item&gt;child-1&lt;/item&gt;
> &lt;/items&gt;
> &lt;properties&gt;
> &lt;childKey&gt;child&lt;/childKey&gt;
> &lt;parentKey&gt;parent&lt;/parentKey&gt;
> &lt;/properties&gt;
> &lt;/configuration&gt;
> &lt;/plugin&gt; 
>  advanced configuration inheritance : combine.children and combine.self 
>  You can control how child POMs inherit configuration from parent POMs by adding attributes to the children of the configuration element. The attributes are combine.children and combine.self . Use these attributes in a child POM to control how Maven combines plugin configuration from the parent with the explicit configuration in the child. 
>  Here is the child configuration with illustrations of the two attributes: 
>  &lt;configuration&gt;
> &lt;items combine.children="append"&gt;
> &lt;!-- combine.children="merge" is the default --&gt;
> &lt;item&gt;child-1&lt;/item&gt;
> &lt;/items&gt;
> &lt;properties combine.self="override"&gt;
> &lt;!-- combine.self="merge" is the default --&gt;
> &lt;childKey&gt;child&lt;/childKey&gt;
> &lt;/properties&gt;
> &lt;/configuration&gt; 
>  Now, the effective result is the following: 
>  &lt;configuration&gt;
> &lt;items combine.children="append"&gt;
> &lt;item&gt;parent-1&lt;/item&gt;
> &lt;item&gt;parent-2&lt;/item&gt;
> &lt;item&gt;child-1&lt;/item&gt;
> &lt;/items&gt;
> &lt;properties combine.self="override"&gt;
> &lt;childKey&gt;child&lt;/childKey&gt;
> &lt;/properties&gt;
> &lt;/configuration&gt; 
>  combine.children="append" results in the concatenation of parent and child elements, in that order. combine.self="override" , on the other hand, completely suppresses parent configuration. You cannot use both combine.self="override" and combine.children="append" on an element; if you try, override will prevail. 
>  Note that these attributes only apply to the configuration element they are declared on, and are not propagated to nested elements. That is if the content of an item element from the child POM was a complex structure instead of text, its sub-elements would still be subject to the default merge strategy unless they were themselves marked with attributes. 
>  The combine.* attributes are inherited from parent to child POMs. Take care when adding those attributes to a parent POM as this might affect child or grand-child POMs. 
>  dependencies : Dependencies are seen a lot within the POM, and are an element under all plugins element blocks. The dependencies have the same structure and function as under that base build. The major difference in this case is that instead of applying as dependencies of the project, they now apply as dependencies of the plugin that they are under. The power of this is to alter the dependency list of a plugin, perhaps by removing an unused runtime dependency via exclusions , or by altering the version of a required dependency. See above under Dependencies for more information. 
>  executions : It is important to keep in mind that a plugin may have multiple goals. Each goal may have a separate configuration, possibly even binding a plugin's goal to a different phase altogether. executions configure the execution of a plugin's goals.
>  For example, suppose you wanted to bind the antrun:run goal to the verify phase. We want the task to echo the build directory, as well as avoid passing on this configuration to its children (assuming it is a parent) by setting inherited to false . You would get an execution like this: 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

> &lt;/executions&gt;
> &lt;/plugin&gt;
> &lt;/plugins&gt;
> &lt;/build&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  
>  id : Self explanatory. It specifies this execution block between all of the others. When the phase is run, it will be shown in the form: [plugin:goal execution: id ] . In the case of this example: [antrun:run execution: echodir ] 
>  goals : Like all pluralized POM elements, this contains a list of singular elements. In this case, a list of plugin goals which are being specified by this execution block. 
>  phase : This is the phase that the list of goals will execute in. This is a very powerful option, allowing one to bind any goal to any phase in the build lifecycle, altering the default behavior of Maven. 
>  inherited : Like the inherited element above, setting this to false will suppress Maven from passing this execution onto its children. This element is only meaningful to parent POMs. 
>  configuration : Same as above, but confines the configuration to this specific list of goals, rather than all goals under the plugin. 
>  Plugin Management 
>  
>  pluginManagement : is an element that is seen along side plugins. Plugin Management contains plugin elements in much the same way, except that rather than configuring plugin information for this particular project build, it is intended to configure project builds that inherit from this one. However, this only configures plugins that are actually referenced within the plugins element in the children or in the current POM. The children have every right to override pluginManagement definitions.

> &lt;/pluginManagement&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/build&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  If we added these specifications to the plugins element, they would apply only to a single POM. However, if we apply them under the pluginManagement element, then this POM and all inheriting POMs that add the maven-jar-plugin to the build will get the pre-process-classes execution as well. So rather than the above mess included in every child pom.xml , only the following is required: 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

> &lt;/build&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  The Build Element Set 
>  The Build type in the XSD denotes those elements that are available only for the "project build". Despite the number of extra elements (six), there are really only two groups of elements that project build contains that are missing from the profile build: directories and extensions. 
>  Directories 
>  The set of directory elements live in the parent build element, which set various directory structures for the POM as a whole. Since they do not exist in profile builds, these cannot be altered by profiles.

>  If the values of a *Directory element above is set as an absolute path (when their properties are expanded) then that directory is used. Otherwise, it is relative to the base build directory: ${project.basedir} . Please note that the scriptSourceDirectory is nowhere used in Maven and is obsolete . 
>  Extensions 
>  Extensions are a list of artifacts that are to be used in this build. They will be included in the running build's classpath. They can enable extensions to the build process (such as add an ftp provider for the Wagon transport mechanism), as well as make plugins active which make changes to the build lifecycle. In short, extensions are artifacts that are activated during build. The extensions do not have to actually do anything nor contain a Mojo. For this reason, extensions are excellent for specifying one out of multiple implementations of a common plugin interface.

>  Reporting 
>  Reporting contains the elements that correspond specifically for the site generation phase. Certain Maven plugins can generate reports defined and configured under the reporting element, for example: generating Javadoc reports. Much like the build element's ability to configure plugins, reporting commands the same ability. The glaring difference is that rather than fine-grained control of plug-in goals within the executions block, reporting configures goals within reportSet elements. And the subtler difference is that a plugin configuration under the reporting element works as build plugin configuration , although the opposite is not true (a build plugin configuration does not affect a reporting plugin). 
>  Possibly the only item under the reporting element that would not be familiar to someone who understood the build element is the Boolean excludeDefaults element. This element signifies to the site generator to exclude reports normally generated by default. When a site is generated via the site build cycle, a Project Info section is placed in the left-hand menu, chock full of reports, such as the Project Team report or Dependencies list report. These report goals are generated by maven-project-info-reports-plugin . Being a plugin like any other, it may also be suppressed in the following, more verbose, way, which effectively turns off project-info reports.

> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  The other difference is the outputDirectory element under plugin . In the case of reporting, the output directory is ${project.basedir}/target/site by default. 
>  Report Sets 
>  It is important to keep in mind that an individual plugin may have multiple goals. Each goal may have a separate configuration. Report sets configure execution of a report plugin's goals. Does this sound familiar - deja-vu? The same thing was said about build's execution element with one difference: you cannot bind a report to another phase. Sorry. 
>  For example, suppose you wanted to configure the javadoc:javadoc goal to link to " http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/ ", but only the javadoc goal (not the goal maven-javadoc-plugin:jar ). We would also like this configuration passed to its children, and set inherited to true. The reportSet would resemble the following: 
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;

> &lt;reports&gt;
> &lt;report&gt;javadoc&lt;/report&gt;
> &lt;/reports&gt;
> &lt;inherited&gt;true&lt;/inherited&gt;
> &lt;configuration&gt;
> &lt;links&gt;
> &lt;link&gt;http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/&lt;/link&gt;
> &lt;/links&gt;
> &lt;/configuration&gt;
> &lt;/reportSet&gt;
> &lt;/reportSets&gt;
> &lt;/plugin&gt;
> &lt;/plugins&gt;
> &lt;/reporting&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  Between build executions and reporting reportSets , it should be clear now as to why they exist. In the simplest sense, they drill down in configuration. The POM must have a way not only to configure plugins, but must also configure the goals of those plugins. That is where these elements come in, giving the POM ultimate granularity in control of its build destiny. 
>  More Project Information 
>  Several elements do not affect the build, but rather document the project for the convenience of developers. Many of these elements are used to fill in project details when generating the project's web site. However, like all POM declarations, plugins can use them for anything. The following are the simplest elements: 
>  
>  name : Projects tend to have conversational names, beyond the artifactId . The Sun engineers did not refer to their project as "java-1.5", but rather just called it "Tiger". Here is where to set that value. 
>  description : A short, human readable description of the project. Although this should not replace formal documentation, a quick comment to any readers of the POM is always helpful. 
>  url : The project's home page. 
>  inceptionYear : The year the project was first created. 
>  Licenses 
>  &lt;licenses&gt;
> &lt;license&gt;
> &lt;name&gt;Apache-2.0&lt;/name&gt;
> &lt;url&gt;https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt&lt;/url&gt;
> &lt;distribution&gt;repo&lt;/distribution&gt;
> &lt;comments&gt;A business-friendly OSS license&lt;/comments&gt;
> &lt;/license&gt;

>  All projects consist of files that were created, at some time, by a person. Like the other systems that surround a project, so to do the people involved with a project have a stake in the project. Developers are presumably members of the project's core development. Note that, although an organization may have many developers (programmers) as members, it is not good form to list them all as developers, but only those who are immediately responsible for the code. A good rule of thumb is, if the person should not be contacted about the project, they do not need to be listed here.

>  Continuous Integration Management 
>  Continuous integration build systems based upon triggers or timings (such as, hourly or daily) have grown in favor over manual builds in the past few years. As build systems have become more standardized, so have the systems that run the trigger those builds. Although the majority of the configuration is up to the specific program used (Continuum, Cruise Control, etc.), there are a few configurations which may take place within the POM. Maven has captured a few of the recurring settings within the set of notifier elements. A notifier is the manner in which people are notified of certain build statuses. In the following example, this POM is setting a notifier of type mail (meaning email), and configuring the email address to use on the specified triggers sendOnError , sendOnFailure , and not sendOnSuccess or sendOnWarning .

>  SCM 
>  SCM (Software Configuration Management, also called Source Code/Control Management or, succinctly, version control) is an integral part of any healthy project. If your Maven project uses an SCM system (it does, doesn't it?) then here is where you would place that information into the POM.

>  connection , developerConnection : The two connection elements convey to how one is to connect to the version control system through Maven. Where connection requires read access for Maven to be able to find the source code (for example, an update), developerConnection requires a connection that will give write access. The Maven project has spawned another project named Maven SCM, which creates a common API for any SCMs that wish to implement it. The most popular are CVS and Subversion, however, there is a growing list of other supported SCMs . All SCM connections are made through a common URL structure.
>  
>  scm:[provider]:[provider_specific] 
>  Where provider is the type of SCM system. For example, connecting to a CVS repository may look like this: 
>  
>  scm:cvs:pserver:127.0.0.1:/cvs/root:my-project 
>  tag : Specifies the tag that this project lives under. HEAD (meaning, the SCM root) is the default. 
>  url : A publicly browsable repository. For example, via ViewCVS. 
>  Prerequisites 
>  The POM may have certain prerequisites in order to execute correctly. The only element that exists as a prerequisite in POM 4.0.0 is the maven element, which takes a minimum version number. 
>  Use Maven Enforcer Plugin's requireMavenVersion rule , or other rules for build-time prerequisites. For packaging maven-plugin this is still used at run-time to make sure that the minimum Maven version for the plugin is met (but only in the pom.xml of the referenced plugin).

>  Repositories 
>  Repositories are collections of artifacts which adhere to the Maven repository directory layout. In order to be a Maven repository artifact, a POM file must live within the structure $BASE_REPO/groupId/artifactId/version/artifactId-version.pom . $BASE_REPO can be local (file structure) or remote (base URL); the remaining layout will be the same. Repositories exist as a place to collect and store artifacts. Whenever a project has a dependency upon an artifact, Maven will first attempt to use a local copy of the specified artifact. If that artifact does not exist in the local repository, it will then attempt to download from a remote repository. The repository elements within a POM specify those alternate repositories to search. 
>  The repository is one of the most powerful features of the Maven community. By default Maven searches the central repository at https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ . Additional repositories can be configured in the pom.xml `repositories` element.

>  releases , snapshots : These are the policies for each type of artifact, Release or snapshot. With these two sets, a POM has the power to alter the policies for each type independent of the other within a single repository. For example, one may decide to enable only snapshot downloads, possibly for development purposes. 
>  enabled : true or false for whether this repository is enabled for the respective type ( releases or snapshots ). By default this is true . 
>  updatePolicy : This element specifies how often Maven tries to update its local repository from the remote repositories. Maven will compare the local POM's timestamp (stored in a repository's maven-metadata file) to the remote. The choices are: always , daily (default), interval:X (where X is an integer in minutes) or never (only downloads if not yet existing in the local repository). As this affects both artifacts and metadata ( supposed to be changed in Maven 4 ) be careful with never , as metadata changes over time (even for release repositories). 
>  checksumPolicy : When Maven deploys files to the repository, it also deploys corresponding checksum files. Your options are to ignore , fail , or warn on missing or incorrect checksums. The default value is warn . 
>  id : The repository id is mandatory and connects the repository with the servers from settings.xml . Its default value is default . The id is used also in the local repository metadata to store the origin. 
>  name : An optional name for the repository. Used as label when emitting log messages related to this repository. 
>  layout : In the above description of repositories, it was mentioned that they all follow a common layout. This is mostly correct. The layout introduced with Maven 2 is the default layout for repositories used by Maven both 2 &amp; 3. However, Maven 1.x had a different layout. Use this element to specify whether it is default or legacy . Its default value is default . 
>  Plugin Repositories 
>  Repositories are home to two major types of artifacts. The first are artifacts that are used as dependencies of other artifacts. These are the majority of artifacts that reside within central. The other type of artifact is plugins. Maven plugins are themselves a special type of artifact. Because of this, plugin repositories may be separated from other repositories (although, I have yet to hear a convincing argument for doing so). In any case, the structure of the pluginRepositories element block is similar to the repositories element. The pluginRepository elements each specify a remote location of where Maven can find new plugins. 
>  Distribution Management 
>  Distribution management acts precisely as it sounds: it manages the distribution of the artifact and supporting files generated throughout the build process.

> &lt;/distributionManagement&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  Repository 
>  Whereas the repositories element specifies in the POM the location and manner in which Maven may download remote artifacts for use by the current project, distributionManagement specifies where (and how) this project will get to a remote repository when it is deployed. The repository elements will be used for snapshot distribution if the snapshotRepository is not defined.

>  Projects are not static; they are living things (or dying things, as the case may be). A common thing that happens as projects grow, is that they are forced to move to more suitable quarters. For example, when your next wildly successful open source project moves under the Apache umbrella, it would be good to give users a heads-up that the project is being renamed to org.apache:my-project:1.0 . Besides specifying the new address, it is also good form to provide a message explaining why.

The reason for this is that Maven will set the status of the project when it is transported out to the repository. It is described here just for understanding, but should never be configured in your pom.xml . 
>  Status valid values are as follows: 
>  
>  none : No special status. This is the default for a POM. 
>  converted : The manager of the repository converted this POM from an earlier version to Maven 2. 
>  partner : This artifact has been synchronized with a partner repository. 
>  deployed : By far the most common status, meaning that this artifact was deployed from a Maven 2 or 3 instance. This is what you get when you manually deploy using the command-line deploy phase. 
>  verified : This project has been verified, and should be considered finalized. 
>  Profiles 
>  A new feature of the POM 4.0 is the ability of a project to change settings depending on the environment where it is being built. A profile element contains both an optional activation (a profile trigger) and the set of changes to be made to the POM if that profile has been activated. For example, a project built for a test environment may point to a different database than that of the final deployment. Or dependencies may be pulled from different repositories based upon the JDK version used. The elements of profiles are as follows:

>  Before Maven 3.2.2 activation occurs when one or more of the specified criteria have been met. When the first positive result is encountered, processing stops and the profile is marked as active. Since Maven 3.2.2 activation occurs when all of the specified criteria have been met. 
>  
>  activeByDefault : Is false by default. Boolean flag which determines if the profile is active by default. This flag is only evaluated if no other profile is explicitly activated via command line, settings.xml or implicitly activated through some other activator, otherwise it has no effect. 
>  jdk : activation has a built in, Java-centric check in the jdk element. The value is one of the following three types:
>  
>  A version range according to the definition of maven-enforcer-plugin in case the value starts with either [ or ( , 
>  A negated prefix if the value starts with ! or 
>  A (non-negated) prefix for all other cases 
>  (Negated) prefix values match if the JDK version used for running Maven starts/doesn't start with the given prefix (excluding the potentially leading ! ). The value ranges match if the JDK version used for running Maven is between lower and upper bounds (either inclusive or exclusive). 
>  os : The os element can require some operating system specific properties having specific values. Each value may start with ! which means the condition is fulfilled if the value following does not equal the actual value, otherwise the condition is fulfilled if the value equals the according system property (or derived value). In both cases the check is case insensitive .
>  
>  name , is matched against system property os.name 
>  family , is matched against the family derived from the other os.* system properties 
>  arch , is matched against system property os.arch 
>  version , is matched against system property os.version . Since Maven 3.9.7 the value for version may be prefixed with regex: . In that case regular pattern matching is applied for the version matching. Note that system property os.version is converted to lower case prior to the matching. 
>  See the maven-enforcer-plugin's Require OS Rule for more details about OS values. 
>  property : The profile will activate if Maven detects a system property or CLI user property (a value which can be dereferenced within the POM by ${name} ) of the corresponding name=value pair and it matches the given value (if given). Since Maven 3.9.0 one can also evaluate the packaging value of the pom via property name packaging . 
>  file : Finally, a given filename may activate the profile by the existence of a file, or if it is missing . NOTE : interpolation for this element is limited to ${basedir} , System properties and request properties. 
>  The POM based profile activation only refers to the container profile (not all profiles with the same id ). 
>  The activation element is not the only way that a profile may be activated. The settings.xml file's activeProfile element may contain the profile's id . They may also be activated explicitly through the command line via a comma separated list after the -P flag (e.g. -P codecoverage ). 
>  To see which profile will activate in a certain build, use the maven-help-plugin . 
>  Further information about profiles is available in Introduction to Build Profiles . 
>  The BaseBuild Element Set (revisited) 
>  As mentioned above, the reason for the two types of build elements reside in the fact that it does not make sense for a profile to configure build directories or extensions as it does in the top level of the POM. Reguardless of in which environment the project is built, some values will remain constant, such as the directory structure of the source code. If you find your project needing to keep two sets of code for different environments, it may be prudent to investigate refactoring the project into two or more separate projects. 
>  Final 
>  The Maven POM is big. However, its size is also a testament to its versatility. The ability to abstract all of the aspects of a project into a single artifact is powerful, to say the least. Gone are the days of dozens of disparate build scripts and scattered documentation concerning each individual project. Along with Maven's other stars that make up the Maven galaxy - a well defined build lifecycle, easy to write and maintain plugins, centralized repositories, system-wide and user-based configurations, as well as the increasing number of tools to make developers' jobs easier to maintain complex projects - the POM is the large, but bright, center.

>  What is Maven? 
>  Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. 
>  
>  How to use this image 
>  You can run a Maven project by using the Maven Docker image directly, passing a Maven command to docker run : 
>  $ docker run -it --rm --name my-maven-project -v " $( pwd ) " :/usr/src/mymaven -w /usr/src/mymaven maven:3.3-jdk-8 mvn clean install 
>  Building local Docker image (optional) 
>  This is a base image that you can extend, so it has the bare minimum packages needed. If you add custom package(s) to the Dockerfile , then you can build your local Docker image like this: 
>  $ docker build --tag my_local_maven:3.5.2-jdk-8 . 
>  Reusing the Maven local repository 
>  The local Maven repository can be reused across containers by creating a volume and mounting it in /root/.m2 . 
>  $ docker volume create --name maven-repo 
> $ docker run -it -v maven-repo:/root/.m2 maven mvn archetype:generate # will download artifacts 
> $ docker run -it -v maven-repo:/root/.m2 maven mvn archetype:generate # will reuse downloaded artifacts 
>  Or you can just use your home .m2 cache directory that you share e.g. with your Eclipse/IDEA: 
>  $ docker run -it --rm -v " $PWD " :/usr/src/mymaven -v " $HOME /.m2 " :/root/.m2 -v " $PWD /target:/usr/src/mymaven/target " -w /usr/src/mymaven maven mvn clean package 
>  Packaging a local repository with the image 
>  The $MAVEN_CONFIG dir (default to /root/.m2 ) could be configured as a volume so anything copied there in a Dockerfile at build time is lost. For that reason the dir /usr/share/maven/ref/ exists, and anything in that directory will be copied on container startup to $MAVEN_CONFIG . 
>  To create a pre-packaged repository, create a pom.xml with the dependencies you need and use this in your Dockerfile . /usr/share/maven/ref/settings-docker.xml is a settings file that changes the local repository to /usr/share/maven/ref/repository , but you can use your own settings file as long as it uses /usr/share/maven/ref/repository as local repo. 
>  COPY pom.xml /tmp/pom.xml
>  RUN mvn -B -f /tmp/pom.xml -s /usr/share/maven/ref/settings-docker.xml dependency:resolve 
>  To add your custom settings.xml file to the image use 
>  COPY settings.xml /usr/share/maven/ref/ 
>  For an example, check the tests dir 
>  Running as non-root 
>  Maven needs the user home to download artifacts to, and if the user does not exist in the image an extra user.home Java property needs to be set. 
>  For example, to run as user 1000 mounting the host' Maven repo 
>  $ docker run -v ~ /.m2:/var/maven/.m2 -ti --rm -u 1000 -e MAVEN_CONFIG=/var/maven/.m2 maven mvn -Duser.home=/var/maven archetype:generate 
>  Image Variants 
>  The maven images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case. 
>  maven:&lt;version&gt; 
>  This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of. 
>  Some of these tags may have names like focal in them. These are the suite code names for releases of Ubuntu and indicate which release the image is based on. If your image needs to install any additional packages beyond what comes with the image, you'll likely want to specify one of these explicitly to minimize breakage when there are new releases of Ubuntu. 
>  maven:&lt;version&gt;-slim 
>  This image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and only contains the minimal packages needed to run maven . Unless you are working in an environment where only the maven image will be deployed and you have space constraints, we highly recommend using the default image of this repository. 
>  maven:&lt;version&gt;-alpine 
>  This image is based on the popular Alpine Linux project , available in the alpine official image . Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general. 
>  This variant is useful when final image size being as small as possible is your primary concern. The main caveat to note is that it does use musl libc instead of glibc and friends , so software will often run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements/assumptions. See this Hacker News comment thread for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images. 
>  To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as git or bash ) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the alpine image description for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar). 
>  License 
>  View license information for the software contained in this image. 
>  As with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained). 
>  Some additional license information which was able to be auto-detected might be found in the repo-info repository's maven/ directory . 
>  As for any pre-built image usage, it is the image user's responsibility to ensure that any use of this image complies with any relevant licenses for all software contained within.
> 
> Having a common directory layout allows users familiar with one Maven project to immediately feel at home in another Maven project. The advantages are analogous to adopting a site-wide look-and-feel. 
>  The next section documents the directory layout expected by Maven and the directory layout created by Maven. Try to conform to this structure as much as possible. However, if you can't, these settings can be overridden via the project descriptor.

>  At the top level, files descriptive of the project: a pom.xml file. In addition, there are textual documents meant for the user to be able to read immediately on receiving the source: README.txt , LICENSE.txt , etc. 
>  There are just two subdirectories of this structure: src and target . The only other directories that would be expected here are metadata like CVS , .git or .svn , and any subprojects in a multiproject build (each of which would be laid out as above). 
>  The target directory is used to house all output of the build. 
>  The src directory contains all of the source material for building the project, its site and so on. It contains a subdirectory for each type: main for the main build artifact, test for the unit test code and resources, site and so on. 
>  Within artifact producing source directories (ie. main and test ), there is one directory for the language java (under which the normal package hierarchy exists), and one for resources (the structure which is copied to the target classpath given the default resource definition). 
>  If there are other contributing sources to the artifact build, they would be under other subdirectories. For example src/main/antlr would contain Antlr grammar definition files.

> Maven configuration occurs at 3 levels: 
>  
>  Project - most static configuration occurs in pom.xml 
>  Installation - this is configuration added once for a Maven installation 
>  User - this is configuration specific to a particular user 
>  The separation is quite clear - the project defines information that applies to the project, no matter who is building it, while the others both define settings for the current environment. 
>  Note: the installation and user configuration cannot be used to add shared project information - for example, setting &lt;organization&gt; or &lt;distributionManagement&gt; company-wide. 
>  For this, you should have your projects inherit from a company-wide parent pom.xml . 
>  You can specify your user configuration in ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml . A full reference to the configuration file is available. This section will show how to make some common configurations. Note that the file is not required - defaults will be used if it is not found. 
>  Configuring your Local Repository 
>  The location of your local repository can be changed in your user configuration. The default value is ${user.home}/.m2/repository/ . 
>  &lt;settings&gt;
> ...
> &lt;localRepository&gt;/path/to/local/repo/&lt;/localRepository&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/settings&gt; 
>  Note: The local repository must be an absolute path. 
>  Configuring a Proxy 
>  Proxy configuration can also be specified in the settings file. 
>  For more information, see the Guide to using a Proxy . 
>  Configuring Parallel Artifact Resolution 
>  By default, Maven 2.1.0+ will download up to 5 artifacts (from different groups) at once. To change the size of the thread pool, start Maven using -Dmaven.artifact.threads . For example, to only download single artifacts at a time: 
>  
>  mvn -Dmaven.artifact.threads=1 verify 
>  You may wish to set this option permanently, in which case you can use the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable. For example: 
>  
>  export MAVEN_OPTS=-Dmaven.artifact.threads=3 
>  Security and Deployment Settings 
>  Repositories to deploy to are defined in a project in the &lt;distributionManagement&gt; section. However, you cannot put your username, password, or other security settings in that project. For that reason, you should add a server definition to your own settings with an id that matches that of the deployment repository in the project. 
>  In addition, some repositories may require authorization to download from, so the corresponding settings can be specified in a server element in the same way. 
>  Which settings are required will depend on the type of repository you are deploying to. As of the first release, only SCP deployments and file deployments are supported by default, so only the following SCP configuration is needed: 
>  &lt;settings&gt;
> ...
> &lt;servers&gt;
> &lt;server&gt;
> &lt;id&gt;repo1&lt;/id&gt;
> &lt;username&gt;repouser&lt;/username&gt;
> &lt;!-- other optional elements:
> &lt;password&gt;my_login_password&lt;/password&gt;
> &lt;privateKey&gt;/path/to/identity&lt;/privateKey&gt; (default is ~/.ssh/id_dsa)
> &lt;passphrase&gt;my_key_passphrase&lt;/passphrase&gt;
> --&gt;
> &lt;/server&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/servers&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/settings&gt; 
>  To encrypt passwords in these sections, refer to Encryption Settings . 
>  Using Mirrors for Repositories 
>  Repositories can be declared inside a project, which means that if you have your own custom repositories, those sharing your project easily get the right settings out of the box. However, you may want to use an alternative mirror for a particular repository without changing the project files. Refer to Guide to Mirror Settings for more details. 
>  Profiles 
>  Repository configuration can also be put into a profile. You can have multiple profiles, with one set to active so that you can easily switch environments. Read more about profiles in Introduction to Build Profiles . 
>  Optional configuration 
>  Maven will work for most tasks with the above configuration, however if you have any environmental specific configuration outside of individual projects then you will need to configure settings. The following sections refer to what is available. 
>  Settings 
>  Maven has a settings file located in the Maven installation and/or user home directory that configure environmental specifics such as: 
>  
>  HTTP proxy server 
>  repository manager location 
>  server authentication and passwords 
>  other configuration properties 
>  For information on this file, see the Settings reference 
>  Security 
>  You can encrypt passwords in your settings file. However, you must first configure a master password. For more information on both server passwords and the master password, see the Guide to Password Encryption . 
>  Toolchains 
>  You can build a project using a specific version of JDK independent from the one Maven is running with. For more information, see the Guide to Using Toolchains .

> The Maven Wrapper is an easy way to ensure a user of your Maven build has
> everything necessary to run your Maven build. 
>  Why might this be necessary? Maven to date has been very stable for users, is
> available on most systems or is easy to procure: but with many of the recent
> changes in Maven it will be easier for users to have a fully encapsulated build
> setup provided by the project. With the Maven Wrapper, this is very easy to do
> and it's a great idea and initial implementation borrowed from Gradle. 
>  The easiest way to setup the Maven Wrapper for your project is to use the
>  Maven Wrapper Plugin with its provided wrapper goal. To add or update all
> the necessary Maven Wrapper files to your project execute the following command: 
>  Normally you instruct users to install a specific version of Apache Maven, put
> it on the PATH and then run the mvn command like the following: 
>  But now, with a Maven Wrapper setup, you can instruct users to run wrapper
> scripts: 
>  or on Windows 
>  A normal Maven build will be executed, with the one important change that if the
> user doesn't have the necessary version of Maven specified in
>  .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties it will be downloaded for the user
> first, installed and then used. 
>  Subsequent uses of mvnw / mvnw.cmd use the previously downloaded, specific
> version as needed. 
>  Supported Systems 
>  The wrapper should work on various operating systems including 
>  
>  Linux (numerous versions, tested on Ubuntu and CentOS) 
>  OSX / macOS 
>  Windows (various newer versions) 
>  Solaris (10 and 11) 
>  BSD 
>  
>  A POSIX-compatible Bourne shell is required to run the wrapper script. 
>  In terms of Apache Maven versions itself, the wrapper should work with any Maven
> 3.x version and it defaults to the release used when setting up the wrapper. We do NOT
> plan to support the deprecated, EOL'ed Maven 2.x. 
>  By default, the only-script type is installed (see below). 
>  Verbose Mode 
>  The wrapper supports a verbose mode in which it outputs further information. It
> is activated by setting the MVNW_VERBOSE environment variable to true . 
>  By default it is off. 
>  Usage with or without Binary JAR 
>  Using type=bin , the Maven Wrapper JAR archive is added to the using project as small
> binary file .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar . It is used to bootstrap the
> download and invocation of Maven from the wrapper shell scripts. 
>  If your project is not allowed to contain binary files like this, you can
> use the source distribution of the maven wrapper which adds a file
>  .mvn/wrapper/MavenWrapperDownloader.java file instead: 
>  mvn wrapper:wrapper -Dtype=source
>  
>  You can also choose to opt out of all additional resources except the wrapper scripts: 
>  mvn wrapper:wrapper -Dtype=script
>  
>  Another type is the lite implementation of mvnw / mvnw.cmd scripts which download the maven directly
> via wget or curl on *nix, or PowerShell on Windows, then call the original mvn / mvn.cmd 
> scripts of the downloaded maven distribution.
> This type does not use maven-wrapper.jar nor MavenWrapperDownloader.java , only the wrapper scripts are required.
> This is the default type being installed, when no type parameter is specified. 
>  mvn wrapper:wrapper -Dtype=only-script
>  
>  If the JAR is not found to be available by the scripts they will attempt to
> download the file from the URL specified in
>  .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties under wrapperUrl and put it in place.
> The download is attempted via curl, wget and, as last resort, by compiling the
>  .mvn/wrapper/MavenWrapperDownloader.java file and executing the resulting
> class. 
>  If your Maven repository is password protected you can specify your username via
> the environment variable MVNW_USERNAME and the password via the environment
> variable MVNW_PASSWORD . 
>  Using a Different Version of Maven 
>  To switch the version of Maven used to build a project, you can initialize it
> using: 
>  mvn wrapper:wrapper -Dmaven=3.5.4
>  
>  which works for any version except snapshots. Once you have a wrapper you can
> change its version by setting the distributionUrl in
>  .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties , e.g. 
>  distributionUrl=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.5.4/apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.zip
>  
>  Using Basic Authentication for Distribution Download 
>  To download Maven from a location that requires Basic Authentication you have 2
> options: 
>  
>  
>  Set the environment variables MVNW_USERNAME and MVNW_PASSWORD 
>  or 
>  
>  
>  add user and password to the distributionUrl like that:
>  distributionUrl=https://username:password@&lt;yourserver&gt;/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.2.1/apache-maven-3.2.1-bin.zip 
>  
>  
>  Specifying Maven Distribution Base Path 
>  This is a feature of Maven itself and the wrapper just happens to take it into
> account. Simply set MAVEN_USER_HOME to the desired path and the wrapper uses
> it as the base of the Maven distro installation. 
>  See https://www.lewuathe.com/maven-wrapper-home.html and
>  https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper/issues/17 
>  Using a Maven Repository Manager 
>  When using an internal Maven repository manager, you have two options: 
>  
>  Just set the correct URL to wrapper jar and Maven distro in
>  maven-wrapper.properties in your project 
>  Leave the default URL in the project pointing to Maven Central and set the
> environment variable MVNW_REPOURL to your repo manager URL such as
>  https://repo.example.com/central-repo-proxy . 
>  
>  If MVNW_REPOURL is set during the wrapper installation with the
> maven-wrapper-plugin, the URL is used in the maven-wrapper.properties file. 
>  If not set, but your mirror URL in your settings.xml is configured, it will be
> used. 
>  Checksum verification of downloaded binaries 
>  To avoid supply-chain-attacks by downloading a corrupted artifact, it
> is possible to specify checksums for both the maven-wrapper.jar and
> the downloaded distribution. To apply verification, add the expected
> file's SHA-256 sum in hex notation, using only small caps, to
>  maven-wrapper.properties . The property for validating the
>  maven-wrapper.jar file is named wrapperSha256Sum whereas the
> distribution file property is named distributionSha256Sum . 
>  Internals 
>  Maven Wrapper is composed of 3 pieces: 
>  
>  
>  maven-wrapper , providing the maven-wrapper.jar that downloads, installs and runs target Maven distribution, 
>  
>  
>  maven-wrapper-distribution , that provides mvnw / mvnw.cmd scripts distributions, 
>

> This guide is intended as a reference for those working with Maven for the first time, but is also intended to serve as a cookbook with self-contained references and solutions for common use cases. For first time users, it is recommended that you step through the material in a sequential fashion. For users more familiar with Maven, this guide endeavours to provide a quick solution for the need at hand. It is assumed at this point that you have downloaded Maven and installed Maven on your local machine. If you have not done so please refer to the Download and Installation instructions. 
>  Ok, so you now have Maven installed and we're ready to go. Before we jump into our examples we'll very briefly go over what Maven is and how it can help you with your daily work and collaborative efforts with team members. Maven will, of course, work for small projects, but Maven shines in helping teams operate more effectively by allowing team members to focus on what the stakeholders of a project require. You can leave the build infrastructure to Maven!

>  At first glance Maven can appear to be many things, but in a nutshell Maven is an attempt to apply patterns to a project's build infrastructure in order to promote comprehension and productivity by providing a clear path in the use of best practices . Maven is essentially a project management and comprehension tool and as such provides a way to help with managing:

>  If you want more background information on Maven you can check out The Philosophy of Maven and The History of Maven . Now let's move on to how you, the user, can benefit from using Maven. 
>  
>  How can Maven benefit my development process? 
>  Maven can provide benefits for your build process by employing standard conventions and practices to accelerate your development cycle while at the same time helping you achieve a higher rate of success. 
>  Now that we have covered a little bit of the history and purpose of Maven let's get into some real examples to get you up and running with Maven! 
>  
>  How do I setup Maven? 
>  The defaults for Maven are often sufficient, but if you need to change the cache location or are behind a HTTP proxy, you will need to create configuration. See the Guide to Configuring Maven for more information. 
>  
>  How do I make my first Maven project? 
>  We are going to jump headlong into creating your first Maven project! To create our first Maven project we are going to use Maven's archetype mechanism. An archetype is defined as an original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made . In Maven, an archetype is a template of a project which is combined with some user input to produce a working Maven project that has been tailored to the user's requirements. We are going to show you how the archetype mechanism works now, but if you would like to know more about archetypes please refer to our Introduction to Archetypes . 
>  On to creating your first project! In order to create the simplest of Maven projects, execute the following from the command line: 
>  
>  mvn -B archetype:generate \
> -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
> -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app \
> -DartifactId=my-app 
>  Once you have executed this command, you will notice a few things have happened. First, you will notice that a directory named my-app has been created for the new project, and this directory contains a file named pom.xml that should look like this: 
>  
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
> xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
> http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;name&gt;Maven Quick Start Archetype&lt;/name&gt;
> &lt;url&gt;http://maven.apache.org&lt;/url&gt;
> &lt;dependencies&gt;
> &lt;dependency&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;3.8.1&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
> &lt;/dependency&gt;
> &lt;/dependencies&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  pom.xml contains the Project Object Model (POM) for this project. The POM is the basic unit of work in Maven. This is important to remember because Maven is inherently project-centric in that everything revolves around the notion of a project. In short, the POM contains every important piece of information about your project and is essentially one-stop-shopping for finding anything related to your project. Understanding the POM is important and new users are encouraged to refer to the Introduction to the POM . 
>  This is a very simple POM but still displays the key elements every POM contains, so let's walk through each of them to familiarize you with the POM essentials: 
>  
>  project This is the top-level element in all Maven pom.xml files. 
>  modelVersion This element indicates what version of the object model this POM is using. The version of the model itself changes very infrequently but it is mandatory in order to ensure stability of use if and when the Maven developers deem it necessary to change the model. 
>  groupId This element indicates the unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project. The groupId is one of the key identifiers of a project and is typically based on the fully qualified domain name of your organization. For example org.apache.maven.plugins is the designated groupId for all Maven plug-ins. 
>  artifactId This element indicates the unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project. The primary artifact for a project is typically a JAR file. Secondary artifacts like source bundles also use the artifactId as part of their final name. A typical artifact produced by Maven would have the form &lt;artifactId&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.&lt;extension&gt; (for example, myapp-1.0.jar). 
>  packaging This element indicates the package type to be used by this artifact (e.g. JAR, WAR, EAR, etc.). This not only means if the artifact produced is JAR, WAR, or EAR but can also indicate a specific lifecycle to use as part of the build process. (The lifecycle is a topic we will deal with further on in the guide. For now, just keep in mind that the indicated packaging of a project can play a part in customizing the build lifecycle.) The default value for the packaging element is JAR so you do not have to specify this for most projects. 
>  version This element indicates the version of the artifact generated by the project. Maven goes a long way to help you with version management and you will often see the SNAPSHOT designator in a version, which indicates that a project is in a state of development. We will discuss the use of snapshots and how they work further on in this guide. 
>  name This element indicates the display name used for the project. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation. 
>  url This element indicates where the project's site can be found. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation. 
>  description This element provides a basic description of your project. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation. 
>  For a complete reference of what elements are available for use in the POM please refer to our POM Reference . Now let's get back to the project at hand. 
>  After the archetype generation of your first project you will also notice that the following directory structure has been created: 
>  
>  my-app
> |-- pom.xml
> `-- src
> |-- main
> | `-- java
> | `-- com
> | `-- mycompany
> | `-- app
> | `-- App.java
> `-- test
> `-- java
> `-- com
> `-- mycompany
> `-- app
> `-- AppTest.java 
>  As you can see, the project created from the archetype has a POM, a source tree for your application's sources and a source tree for your test sources. This is the standard layout for Maven projects (the application sources reside in ${basedir}/src/main/java and test sources reside in ${basedir}/src/test/java, where ${basedir} represents the directory containing pom.xml). 
>  If you were to create a Maven project by hand this is the directory structure that we recommend using. This is a Maven convention and to learn more about it you can read our Introduction to the Standard Directory Layout . 
>  Now that we have a POM, some application sources, and some test sources you are probably asking... 
>  
>  How do I compile my application sources? 
>  Change to the directory where pom.xml is created by archetype:generate and execute the following command to compile your application sources: 
>  Upon executing this command you should see output like the following:

>  The first time you execute this (or any other) command, Maven will need to download all the plugins and related dependencies it needs to fulfill the command. From a clean installation of Maven, this can take quite a while (in the output above, it took almost 4 minutes). If you execute the command again, Maven will now have what it needs, so it won't need to download anything new and will be able to execute the command much more quickly. 
>  As you can see from the output, the compiled classes were placed in ${basedir}/target/classes, which is another standard convention employed by Maven. So, if you're a keen observer, you'll notice that by using the standard conventions, the POM above is very small and you haven't had to tell Maven explicitly where any of your sources are or where the output should go. By following the standard Maven conventions, you can get a lot done with very little effort! Just as a casual comparison, let's take a look at what you might have had to do in Ant to accomplish the same thing .

This is how Maven knows to produce a JAR file from the above command (we'll talk more about this later). You can now take a look in the ${basedir}/target directory and you will see the generated JAR file. 
>  Now you'll want to install the artifact you've generated (the JAR file) in your local repository (~/.m2/repository is the default location).

>  You have walked through the process for setting up, building, testing, packaging, and installing a typical Maven project. This is likely the vast majority of what projects will be doing with Maven and if you've noticed, everything you've been able to do up to this point has been driven by an 18-line file, namely the project's model or POM. If you look at a typical Ant build file that provides the same functionality that we've achieved thus far you'll notice it's already twice the size of the POM and we're just getting started! There is far more functionality available to you from Maven without requiring any additions to our POM as it currently stands. To get any more functionality out of our example Ant build file you must keep making error-prone additions. 
>  So what else can you get for free? There are a great number of Maven plug-ins that work out of the box with even a simple POM like we have above. We'll mention one here specifically as it is one of the highly prized features of Maven: without any work on your part this POM has enough information to generate a web site for your project! You will most likely want to customize your Maven site but if you're pressed for time all you need to do to provide basic information about your project is execute the following command: 
>  There are plenty of other standalone goals that can be executed as well, for example: 
>  This will remove the target directory with all the build data before starting so that it is fresh. 
>  Perhaps you'd like to generate an IntelliJ IDEA descriptor for the project? 
>  This can be run over the top of a previous IDEA project - it will update the settings rather than starting fresh. 
>  If you are using Eclipse IDE, just call: 
>  Note: some familiar goals from Maven 1.0 are still there - such as jar:jar, but they might not behave like you'd expect. Presently, jar:jar will not recompile sources - it will simply just create a JAR from the target/classes directory, under the assumption everything else had already been done. 
>  
>  How do I use plug-ins? 
>  Whenever you want to customise the build for a Maven project, this is done by adding or reconfiguring plugins. 
>  Note for Maven 1.0 Users: In Maven 1.0, you would have added some preGoal to maven.xml and some entries to project.properties. Here, it is a little different. 
>  For this example, we will configure the Java compiler to allow JDK 5.0 sources. This is as simple as adding this to your POM: 
>  
>  ...
> &lt;build&gt;
> &lt;plugins&gt;
> &lt;plugin&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;2.5.1&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;configuration&gt;
> &lt;source&gt;1.5&lt;/source&gt;
> &lt;target&gt;1.5&lt;/target&gt;
> &lt;/configuration&gt;
> &lt;/plugin&gt;
> &lt;/plugins&gt;
> &lt;/build&gt;
> ... 
>  You'll notice that all plugins in Maven 2.0 look much like a dependency - and in some ways they are. This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used - including a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the latest available). 
>  The configuration element applies the given parameters to every goal from the compiler plugin. In the above case, the compiler plugin is already used as part of the build process and this just changes the configuration. It is also possible to add new goals to the process, and configure specific goals. For information on this, see the Introduction to the Build Lifecycle . 
>  To find out what configuration is available for a plugin, you can see the Plugins List and navigate to the plugin and goal you are using. For general information about how to configure the available parameters of a plugin, have a look at the Guide to Configuring Plug-ins . 
>  
>  How do I add resources to my JAR? 
>  Another common use case that can be satisfied which requires no changes to the POM that we have above is packaging resources in the JAR file. For this common task, Maven again relies on the Standard Directory Layout , which means by using standard Maven conventions you can package resources within JARs simply by placing those resources in a standard directory structure. 
>  You see below in our example we have added the directory ${basedir}/src/main/resources into which we place any resources we wish to package in our JAR. The simple rule employed by Maven is this: any directories or files placed within the ${basedir}/src/main/resources directory are packaged in your JAR with the exact same structure starting at the base of the JAR. 
>  
>  my-app
> |-- pom.xml
> `-- src
> |-- main
> | |-- java
> | | `-- com
> | | `-- mycompany
> | | `-- app
> | | `-- App.java
> | `-- resources
> | `-- META-INF
> | `-- application.properties
> `-- test
> `-- java
> `-- com
> `-- mycompany
> `-- app
> `-- AppTest.java 
>  So you can see in our example that we have a META-INF directory with an application.properties file within that directory. If you unpacked the JAR that Maven created for you and took a look at it you would see the following: 
>  
>  |-- META-INF
> | |-- MANIFEST.MF
> | |-- application.properties
> | `-- maven
> | `-- com.mycompany.app
> | `-- my-app
> | |-- pom.properties
> | `-- pom.xml
> `-- com
> `-- mycompany
> `-- app
> `-- App.class 
>  As you can see, the contents of ${basedir}/src/main/resources can be found starting at the base of the JAR and our application.properties file is there in the META-INF directory. You will also notice some other files there like META-INF/MANIFEST.MF as well as a pom.xml and pom.properties file. These come standard with generation of a JAR in Maven. You can create your own manifest if you choose, but Maven will generate one by default if you don't. (You can also modify the entries in the default manifest. We will touch on this later.) The pom.xml and pom.properties files are packaged up in the JAR so that each artifact produced by Maven is self-describing and also allows you to utilize the metadata in your own application if the need arises. One simple use might be to retrieve the version of your application. Operating on the POM file would require you to use some Maven utilities but the properties can be utilized using the standard Java API and look like the following: 
>  
>  #Generated by Maven
> #Tue Oct 04 15:43:21 GMT-05:00 2005
> version=1.0-SNAPSHOT
> groupId=com.mycompany.app
> artifactId=my-app 
>  To add resources to the classpath for your unit tests, you follow the same pattern as you do for adding resources to the JAR except the directory you place resources in is ${basedir}/src/test/resources. At this point you would have a project directory structure that would look like the following: 
>  
>  my-app
> |-- pom.xml
> `-- src
> |-- main
> | |-- java
> | | `-- com
> | | `-- mycompany
> | | `-- app
> | | `-- App.java
> | `-- resources
> | `-- META-INF
> | |-- application.properties
> `-- test
> |-- java
> | `-- com
> | `-- mycompany
> | `-- app
> | `-- AppTest.java
> `-- resources
> `-- test.properties 
>  In a unit test you could use a simple snippet of code like the following to access the resource required for testing: 
>  
>  ...
> // Retrieve resource
> InputStream is = getClass().getResourceAsStream( "/test.properties" );
> // Do something with the resource
> ... 
>  
>  How do I filter resource files? 
>  Sometimes a resource file will need to contain a value that can only be supplied at build time. To accomplish this in Maven, put a reference to the property that will contain the value into your resource file using the syntax ${&lt;property name&gt;}. The property can be one of the values defined in your pom.xml, a value defined in the user's settings.xml, a property defined in an external properties file, or a system property. 
>  To have Maven filter resources when copying, simply set filtering to true for the resource directory in your pom.xml: 
>  
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
> xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0

> &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;
> &lt;name&gt;Maven Quick Start Archetype&lt;/name&gt;
> &lt;url&gt;http://maven.apache.org&lt;/url&gt;
> &lt;dependencies&gt;
> &lt;dependency&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;3.8.1&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
> &lt;/dependency&gt;
> &lt;/dependencies&gt;
> &lt;build&gt;
> &lt;resources&gt;
> &lt;resource&gt;
> &lt;directory&gt;src/main/resources&lt;/directory&gt;
> &lt;filtering&gt;true&lt;/filtering&gt;
> &lt;/resource&gt;
> &lt;/resources&gt;
> &lt;/build&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  You'll notice that we had to add the build, resources, and resource elements which weren't there before. In addition, we had to explicitly state that the resources are located in the src/main/resources directory. All of this information was provided as default values previously, but because the default value for filtering is false, we had to add this to our pom.xml in order to override that default value and set filtering to true. 
>  To reference a property defined in your pom.xml, the property name uses the names of the XML elements that define the value, with "pom" being allowed as an alias for the project (root) element. So ${pom.name} refers to the name of the project, ${pom.version} refers to the version of the project, ${pom.build.finalName} refers to the final name of the file created when the built project is packaged, etc. Note that some elements of the POM have default values, so don't need to be explicitly defined in your pom.xml for the values to be available here. Similarly, values in the user's settings.xml can be referenced using property names beginning with "settings" (for example, ${settings.localRepository} refers to the path of the user's local repository). 
>  To continue our example, let's add a couple of properties to the application.properties file (which we put in the src/main/resources directory) whose values will be supplied when the resource is filtered: 
>  
>  # application.properties
> application.name=${pom.name}
> application.version=${pom.version} 
>  With that in place, you can execute the following command (process-resources is the build lifecycle phase where the resources are copied and filtered): 
>  and the application.properties file under target/classes (and will eventually go into the jar) looks like this: 
>  
>  # application.properties
> application.name=Maven Quick Start Archetype
> application.version=1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  To reference a property defined in an external file, all you need to do is add a reference to this external file in your pom.xml. First, let's create our external properties file and call it src/main/filters/filter.properties: 
>  
>  # filter.properties
> my.filter.value=hello! 
>  Next, we'll add a reference to this new file in the pom.xml: 
>  
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"

As an alternative to defining the my.filter.value property in an external file, you could also have defined it in the properties section of your pom.xml and you'd get the same effect (notice I don't need the references to src/main/filters/filter.properties either):

>  Filtering resources can also get values from system properties; either the system properties built into Java (like java.version or user.home) or properties defined on the command line using the standard Java -D parameter. To continue the example, let's change our application.properties file to look like this: 
>  
>  # application.properties
> java.version=${java.version}
> command.line.prop=${command.line.prop} 
>  Now, when you execute the following command (note the definition of the command.line.prop property on the command line), the application.properties file will contain the values from the system properties. 
>  
>  mvn process-resources "-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again" 
>  
>  How do I use external dependencies? 
>  You've probably already noticed a dependencies element in the POM we've been using as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all this time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For a more thorough introduction, please refer to our Introduction to Dependency Mechanism . 
>  The dependencies section of the pom.xml lists all of the external dependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that dependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our project is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering stuff for clarity): 
>  
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"

> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;
> &lt;name&gt;Maven Quick Start Archetype&lt;/name&gt;
> &lt;url&gt;http://maven.apache.org&lt;/url&gt;
> &lt;dependencies&gt;
> &lt;dependency&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;3.8.1&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
> &lt;/dependency&gt;
> &lt;/dependencies&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  For each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things: groupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version are the same as those given in the pom.xml for the project that built that dependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency, and can be values like compile, test, and runtime. For more information on everything you can specify for a dependency, see the Project Descriptor Reference . 
>  For more information about the dependency mechanism as a whole, see Introduction to Dependency Mechanism . 
>  With this information about a dependency, Maven will be able to reference the dependency when it builds the project. Where does Maven reference the dependency from? Maven looks in your local repository (~/.m2/repository is the default location) to find all dependencies. In a previous section , we installed the artifact from our project (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's installed there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply by adding the dependency information to its pom.xml: 
>  
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
> xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
> http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-other-app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> ...
> &lt;dependencies&gt;
> ...
> &lt;dependency&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
> &lt;/dependency&gt;
> &lt;/dependencies&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  What about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local repository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in the local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote repository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a lot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were dependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default, the remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ . You can also set up your own remote repository (maybe a central repository for your company) to use instead of or in addition to the default remote repository. For more information on repositories you can refer to the Introduction to Repositories . 
>  Let's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some logging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to know what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. We can browse ibiblio and look for it, or use Google to help by searching for "site:www.ibiblio.org maven2 log4j". The search shows a directory called /maven2/log4j/log4j (or /pub/packages/maven2/log4j/log4j). In that directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-metadata.xml for log4j looks like: 
>  
>  &lt;metadata&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.1.3&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;versioning&gt;
> &lt;versions&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.1.3&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.2.4&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.2.5&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.2.6&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.2.7&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.2.8&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.2.11&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.2.9&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.2.12&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;/versions&gt;
> &lt;/versioning&gt;
> &lt;/metadata&gt; 
>  From this file, we can see that the groupId we want is "log4j" and the artifactId is "log4j". We see lots of different version values to choose from; for now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml files may also specify which version is the current release version). Alongside the maven-metadata.xml file, we can see a directory corresponding to each version of the log4j library. Inside each of these, we'll find the actual jar file (e.g. log4j-1.2.12.jar) as well as a pom file (this is the pom.xml for the dependency, indicating any further dependencies it might have and other information) and another maven-metadata.xml file. There's also an md5 file corresponding to each of these, which contains an MD5 hash for these files. You can use this to authenticate the library or to figure out which version of a particular library you may be using already. 
>  Now that we know the information we need, we can add the dependency to our pom.xml:

> &lt;/dependency&gt;
> &lt;/dependencies&gt;

>  Now, when we compile the project (mvn compile), we'll see Maven download the log4j dependency for us. 
>  
>  How do I deploy my jar in my remote repository? 
>  For deploying jars to an external repository, you have to configure the repository url in the pom.xml and the authentication information for connectiong to the repository in the settings.xml.

You might want to switch to public key authentication in this case. 
>  Care should be taken if using passwords in settings.xml. For more information, see Password Encryption . 
>  
>  How do I create documentation? 
>  To get you jump started with Maven's documentation system you can use the archetype mechanism to generate a site for your existing project using the following command: 
>  
>  mvn archetype:generate \
> -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
> -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-site \
> -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app \
> -DartifactId=my-app-site 
>  Now head on over to the Guide to creating a site to learn how to create the documentation for your project. 
>  
>  How do I build other types of projects? 
>  Note that the lifecycle applies to any project type. For example, back in the base directory we can create a simple web application: 
>  
>  mvn archetype:generate \
> -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
> -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp \
> -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app \
> -DartifactId=my-webapp 
>  Note that these must all be on a single line. This will create a directory called my-webapp containing the following project descriptor: 
>  
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
> xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
> http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-webapp&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;packaging&gt;war&lt;/packaging&gt;
> &lt;dependencies&gt;
> &lt;dependency&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;3.8.1&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
> &lt;/dependency&gt;
> &lt;/dependencies&gt;
> &lt;build&gt;
> &lt;finalName&gt;my-webapp&lt;/finalName&gt;
> &lt;/build&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  Note the &lt;packaging&gt; element - this tells Maven to build as a WAR. Change into the webapp project's directory and try: 
>  You'll see target/my-webapp.war is built, and that all the normal steps were executed. 
>  
>  How do I build more than one project at once? 
>  The concept of dealing with multiple modules is built in to Maven 2.0. In this section, we will show how to build the WAR above, and include the previous JAR as well in one step. 
>  Firstly, we need to add a parent pom.xml file in the directory above the other two, so it should look like this: 
>  
>  +- pom.xml
> +- my-app
> | +- pom.xml
> | +- src
> | +- main
> | +- java
> +- my-webapp
> | +- pom.xml
> | +- src
> | +- main
> | +- webapp 
>  The POM file you'll create should contain the following: 
>  
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
> xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
> http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;packaging&gt;pom&lt;/packaging&gt;
> &lt;modules&gt;
> &lt;module&gt;my-app&lt;/module&gt;
> &lt;module&gt;my-webapp&lt;/module&gt;
> &lt;/modules&gt;
> &lt;/project&gt; 
>  We'll need a dependency on the JAR from the webapp, so add this to my-webapp/pom.xml: 
>  
>  ...
> &lt;dependencies&gt;
> &lt;dependency&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;my-app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;/dependency&gt;
> ...
> &lt;/dependencies&gt; 
>  Finally, add the following &lt;parent&gt; element to both of the other pom.xml files in the subdirectories: 
>  
>  &lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
> xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
> xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
> http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
> &lt;parent&gt;
> &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
> &lt;artifactId&gt;app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
> &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
> &lt;/parent&gt;
> ... 
>  Now, try it... from the top level directory, run: 
>  The WAR has now been created in my-webapp/target/my-webapp.war, and the JAR is included: 
>  
>  $ jar tvf my-webapp/target/my-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war

>  How does this work? Firstly, the parent POM created (called app), has a packaging of pom and a list of modules defined. This tells Maven to run all operations over the set of projects instead of just the current one (to override this behaviour, you can use the --non-recursive command line option). 
>  Next, we tell the WAR that it requires the my-app JAR. This does a few things: it makes it available on the classpath to any code in the WAR (none in this case), it makes sure the JAR is always built before the WAR, and it indicates to the WAR plugin to include the JAR in its library directory. 
>  You may have noticed that junit-3.8.1.jar was a dependency, but didn't end up in the WAR. The reason for this is the &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt; element - it is only required for testing, and so is not included in the web application as the compile time dependency my-app is. 
>  The final step was to include a parent definition. This is different to the extend element you may be familiar with from Maven 1.0: this ensures that the POM can always be located even if the project is distributed separately from its parent by looking it up in the repository. 
>  Unlike Maven 1.0, it is not required that you run install to successfully perform these steps - you can run package on its own and the artifacts in the reactor will be used from the target directories instead of the local repository. 
>  You might like to generate your IDEA workspace again from the top level directory...

> Maven Getting Started Guide
> This guide is intended as a reference for those working with Maven for the first time, but is also intended to serve as a cookbook with self-contained references and solutions for common use cases. For first time users, it is recommended that you step through the material in a sequential fashion. For users more familiar with Maven, this guide endeavours to provide a quick solution for the need at hand. It is assumed at this point that you have downloaded Maven and installed Maven on your local machine. If you have not done so please refer to the Download and Installation instructions.
> Ok, so you now have Maven installed and we're ready to go. Before we jump into our examples we'll very briefly go over what Maven is and how it can help you with your daily work and collaborative efforts with team members. Maven will, of course, work for small projects, but Maven shines in helping teams operate more effectively by allowing team members to focus on what the stakeholders of a project require. You can leave the build infrastructure to Maven!

> What is Maven?
> At first glance Maven can appear to be many things, but in a nutshell Maven is an attempt to apply patterns to a project's build infrastructure in order to promote comprehension and productivity by providing a clear path in the use of best practices. Maven is essentially a project management and comprehension tool and as such provides a way to help with managing:
> * Builds
> * Documentation
> * Reporting
> * Dependencies
> * SCMs
> * Releases
> * Distribution
> If you want more background information on Maven you can check out The Philosophy of Maven and The History of Maven. Now let's move on to how you, the user, can benefit from using Maven.
> How can Maven benefit my development process?
> Maven can provide benefits for your build process by employing standard conventions and practices to accelerate your development cycle while at the same time helping you achieve a higher rate of success.
> Now that we have covered a little bit of the history and purpose of Maven let's get into some real examples to get you up and running with Maven!
> How do I setup Maven?
> The defaults for Maven are often sufficient, but if you need to change the cache location or are behind a HTTP proxy, you will need to create configuration. See the Guide to Configuring Maven for more information.
> How do I make my first Maven project?
> We are going to jump headlong into creating your first Maven project! To create our first Maven project we are going to use Maven's archetype mechanism. An archetype is defined as an original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made. In Maven, an archetype is a template of a project which is combined with some user input to produce a working Maven project that has been tailored to the user's requirements. We are going to show you how the archetype mechanism works now, but if you would like to know more about archetypes please refer to our Introduction to Archetypes.
> On to creating your first project! In order to create the simplest of Maven projects, execute the following from the command line:
> mvn -B archetype:generate \
> -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
> -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app \
> -DartifactId=my-app
> Once you have executed this command, you will notice a few things have happened. First, you will notice that a directory named my-app has been created for the new project, and this directory contains a file named pom.xml that should look like this:
>  
>  4.0.0 
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-app 
>  jar 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  Maven Quick Start Archetype 
>  http://maven.apache.org 
>  
>  
>  junit 
>  junit 
>  3.8.1 
>  test 
>

>  
> pom.xml contains the Project Object Model (POM) for this project. The POM is the basic unit of work in Maven. This is important to remember because Maven is inherently project-centric in that everything revolves around the notion of a project. In short, the POM contains every important piece of information about your project and is essentially one-stop-shopping for finding anything related to your project. Understanding the POM is important and new users are encouraged to refer to the Introduction to the POM.
> This is a very simple POM but still displays the key elements every POM contains, so let's walk through each of them to familiarize you with the POM essentials:
> * project This is the top-level element in all Maven pom.xml files.
> * modelVersion This element indicates what version of the object model this POM is using. The version of the model itself changes very infrequently but it is mandatory in order to ensure stability of use if and when the Maven developers deem it necessary to change the model.
> * groupId This element indicates the unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project. The groupId is one of the key identifiers of a project and is typically based on the fully qualified domain name of your organization. For example org.apache.maven.plugins is the designated groupId for all Maven plug-ins.
> * artifactId This element indicates the unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project. The primary artifact for a project is typically a JAR file. Secondary artifacts like source bundles also use the artifactId as part of their final name. A typical artifact produced by Maven would have the form - . (for example, myapp-1.0.jar).
> * packaging This element indicates the package type to be used by this artifact (e.g. JAR, WAR, EAR, etc.). This not only means if the artifact produced is JAR, WAR, or EAR but can also indicate a specific lifecycle to use as part of the build process. (The lifecycle is a topic we will deal with further on in the guide. For now, just keep in mind that the indicated packaging of a project can play a part in customizing the build lifecycle.) The default value for the packaging element is JAR so you do not have to specify this for most projects.
> * version This element indicates the version of the artifact generated by the project. Maven goes a long way to help you with version management and you will often see the SNAPSHOT designator in a version, which indicates that a project is in a state of development. We will discuss the use of snapshots and how they work further on in this guide.
> * name This element indicates the display name used for the project. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation.
> * url This element indicates where the project's site can be found. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation.
> * description This element provides a basic description of your project. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation.
> For a complete reference of what elements are available for use in the POM please refer to our POM Reference. Now let's get back to the project at hand.
> After the archetype generation of your first project you will also notice that the following directory structure has been created:
> my-app
> |-- pom.xml
> `-- src
> |-- main
> | `-- java
> | `-- com
> | `-- mycompany
> | `-- app
> | `-- App.java
> `-- test
> `-- java
> `-- com
> `-- mycompany
> `-- app
> `-- AppTest.java
> As you can see, the project created from the archetype has a POM, a source tree for your application's sources and a source tree for your test sources. This is the standard layout for Maven projects (the application sources reside in ${basedir}/src/main/java and test sources reside in ${basedir}/src/test/java, where ${basedir} represents the directory containing pom.xml).
> If you were to create a Maven project by hand this is the directory structure that we recommend using. This is a Maven convention and to learn more about it you can read our Introduction to the Standard Directory Layout.
> Now that we have a POM, some application sources, and some test sources you are probably asking...
> How do I compile my application sources?
> Change to the directory where pom.xml is created by archetype:generate and execute the following command to compile your application sources:
> mvn compile
> Upon executing this command you should see output like the following:

> The first time you execute this (or any other) command, Maven will need to download all the plugins and related dependencies it needs to fulfill the command. From a clean installation of Maven, this can take quite a while (in the output above, it took almost 4 minutes). If you execute the command again, Maven will now have what it needs, so it won't need to download anything new and will be able to execute the command much more quickly.
> As you can see from the output, the compiled classes were placed in ${basedir}/target/classes, which is another standard convention employed by Maven. So, if you're a keen observer, you'll notice that by using the standard conventions, the POM above is very small and you haven't had to tell Maven explicitly where any of your sources are or where the output should go. By following the standard Maven conventions, you can get a lot done with very little effort! Just as a casual comparison, let's take a look at what you might have had to do in Ant to accomplish the same thing.
> Now, this is simply to compile a single tree of application sources and the Ant script shown is pretty much the same size as the POM shown above. But we'll see how much more we can do with just that simple POM!
> How do I compile my test sources and run my unit tests?
> Now you're successfully compiling your application's sources and now you've got some unit tests that you want to compile and execute (because every programmer always writes and executes their unit tests *nudge nudge wink wink*).

> Some things to notice about the output:
> * Maven downloads more dependencies this time. These are the dependencies and plugins necessary for executing the tests (it already has the dependencies it needs for compiling and won't download them again).
> * Before compiling and executing the tests Maven compiles the main code (all these classes are up to date because we haven't changed anything since we compiled last).

> Now you'll want to install the artifact you've generated (the JAR file) in your local repository (~/.m2/repository is the default location).

> You have walked through the process for setting up, building, testing, packaging, and installing a typical Maven project. This is likely the vast majority of what projects will be doing with Maven and if you've noticed, everything you've been able to do up to this point has been driven by an 18-line file, namely the project's model or POM. If you look at a typical Ant build file that provides the same functionality that we've achieved thus far you'll notice it's already twice the size of the POM and we're just getting started! There is far more functionality available to you from Maven without requiring any additions to our POM as it currently stands. To get any more functionality out of our example Ant build file you must keep making error-prone additions.
> So what else can you get for free? There are a great number of Maven plug-ins that work out of the box with even a simple POM like we have above. We'll mention one here specifically as it is one of the highly prized features of Maven: without any work on your part this POM has enough information to generate a web site for your project! You will most likely want to customize your Maven site but if you're pressed for time all you need to do to provide basic information about your project is execute the following command:
> mvn site
> There are plenty of other standalone goals that can be executed as well, for example:
> mvn clean
> This will remove the target directory with all the build data before starting so that it is fresh.
> Perhaps you'd like to generate an IntelliJ IDEA descriptor for the project?
> mvn idea:idea
> This can be run over the top of a previous IDEA project - it will update the settings rather than starting fresh.
> If you are using Eclipse IDE, just call:
> mvn eclipse:eclipse
> Note: some familiar goals from Maven 1.0 are still there - such as jar:jar, but they might not behave like you'd expect. Presently, jar:jar will not recompile sources - it will simply just create a JAR from the target/classes directory, under the assumption everything else had already been done.
> How do I use plug-ins?
> Whenever you want to customise the build for a Maven project, this is done by adding or reconfiguring plugins.
> Note for Maven 1.0 Users: In Maven 1.0, you would have added some preGoal to maven.xml and some entries to project.properties. Here, it is a little different.
> For this example, we will configure the Java compiler to allow JDK 5.0 sources. This is as simple as adding this to your POM:
> ...
>  
>  
>  
>  org.apache.maven.plugins 
>  maven-compiler-plugin 
>  2.5.1 
>  
>  1.5 
>  1.5 
>  
>  
>  
>  
> ...
> You'll notice that all plugins in Maven 2.0 look much like a dependency - and in some ways they are. This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used - including a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the latest available).
> The configuration element applies the given parameters to every goal from the compiler plugin. In the above case, the compiler plugin is already used as part of the build process and this just changes the configuration. It is also possible to add new goals to the process, and configure specific goals. For information on this, see the Introduction to the Build Lifecycle.
> To find out what configuration is available for a plugin, you can see the Plugins List and navigate to the plugin and goal you are using. For general information about how to configure the available parameters of a plugin, have a look at the Guide to Configuring Plug-ins.
> How do I add resources to my JAR?
> Another common use case that can be satisfied which requires no changes to the POM that we have above is packaging resources in the JAR file. For this common task, Maven again relies on the Standard Directory Layout, which means by using standard Maven conventions you can package resources within JARs simply by placing those resources in a standard directory structure.
> You see below in our example we have added the directory ${basedir}/src/main/resources into which we place any resources we wish to package in our JAR. The simple rule employed by Maven is this: any directories or files placed within the ${basedir}/src/main/resources directory are packaged in your JAR with the exact same structure starting at the base of the JAR.
> my-app
> |-- pom.xml
> `-- src
> |-- main
> | |-- java
> | | `-- com
> | | `-- mycompany
> | | `-- app
> | | `-- App.java
> | `-- resources
> | `-- META-INF
> | `-- application.properties
> `-- test
> `-- java
> `-- com
> `-- mycompany
> `-- app
> `-- AppTest.java
> So you can see in our example that we have a META-INF directory with an application.properties file within that directory. If you unpacked the JAR that Maven created for you and took a look at it you would see the following:
> |-- META-INF
> | |-- MANIFEST.MF
> | |-- application.properties
> | `-- maven
> | `-- com.mycompany.app
> | `-- my-app
> | |-- pom.properties
> | `-- pom.xml
> `-- com
> `-- mycompany
> `-- app
> `-- App.class
> As you can see, the contents of ${basedir}/src/main/resources can be found starting at the base of the JAR and our application.properties file is there in the META-INF directory. You will also notice some other files there like META-INF/MANIFEST.MF as well as a pom.xml and pom.properties file. These come standard with generation of a JAR in Maven. You can create your own manifest if you choose, but Maven will generate one by default if you don't. (You can also modify the entries in the default manifest. We will touch on this later.) The pom.xml and pom.properties files are packaged up in the JAR so that each artifact produced by Maven is self-describing and also allows you to utilize the metadata in your own application if the need arises. One simple use might be to retrieve the version of your application. Operating on the POM file would require you to use some Maven utilities but the properties can be utilized using the standard Java API and look like the following:
> #Generated by Maven
> #Tue Oct 04 15:43:21 GMT-05:00 2005
> version=1.0-SNAPSHOT
> groupId=com.mycompany.app
> artifactId=my-app
> To add resources to the classpath for your unit tests, you follow the same pattern as you do for adding resources to the JAR except the directory you place resources in is ${basedir}/src/test/resources. At this point you would have a project directory structure that would look like the following:
> my-app
> |-- pom.xml
> `-- src
> |-- main
> | |-- java
> | | `-- com
> | | `-- mycompany
> | | `-- app
> | | `-- App.java
> | `-- resources
> | `-- META-INF
> | |-- application.properties
> `-- test
> |-- java
> | `-- com
> | `-- mycompany
> | `-- app
> | `-- AppTest.java
> `-- resources
> `-- test.properties
> In a unit test you could use a simple snippet of code like the following to access the resource required for testing:
> ...
> // Retrieve resource
> InputStream is = getClass().getResourceAsStream( "/test.properties" );
> // Do something with the resource
> ...
> How do I filter resource files?
> Sometimes a resource file will need to contain a value that can only be supplied at build time. To accomplish this in Maven, put a reference to the property that will contain the value into your resource file using the syntax ${ }. The property can be one of the values defined in your pom.xml, a value defined in the user's settings.xml, a property defined in an external properties file, or a system property.
> To have Maven filter resources when copying, simply set filtering to true for the resource directory in your pom.xml:
>  
>  4.0.0 
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  jar 
>  Maven Quick Start Archetype 
>  http://maven.apache.org 
>  
>  
>  junit 
>  junit 
>  3.8.1 
>  test 
>  
>  
>  
>  
>  
>  src/main/resources 
>  true 
>  
>  
>  
>  
> You'll notice that we had to add the build, resources, and resource elements which weren't there before. In addition, we had to explicitly state that the resources are located in the src/main/resources directory. All of this information was provided as default values previously, but because the default value for filtering is false, we had to add this to our pom.xml in order to override that default value and set filtering to true.
> To reference a property defined in your pom.xml, the property name uses the names of the XML elements that define the value, with "pom" being allowed as an alias for the project (root) element. So ${pom.name} refers to the name of the project, ${pom.version} refers to the version of the project, ${pom.build.finalName} refers to the final name of the file created when the built project is packaged, etc. Note that some elements of the POM have default values, so don't need to be explicitly defined in your pom.xml for the values to be available here. Similarly, values in the user's settings.xml can be referenced using property names beginning with "settings" (for example, ${settings.localRepository} refers to the path of the user's local repository).
> To continue our example, let's add a couple of properties to the application.properties file (which we put in the src/main/resources directory) whose values will be supplied when the resource is filtered:
> # application.properties
> application.name=${pom.name}
> application.version=${pom.version}
> With that in place, you can execute the following command (process-resources is the build lifecycle phase where the resources are copied and filtered):
> mvn process-resources
> and the application.properties file under target/classes (and will eventually go into the jar) looks like this:
> # application.properties
> application.name=Maven Quick Start Archetype
> application.version=1.0-SNAPSHOT
> To reference a property defined in an external file, all you need to do is add a reference to this external file in your pom.xml. First, let's create our external properties file and call it src/main/filters/filter.properties:
> # filter.properties
> my.filter.value=hello!
> Next, we'll add a reference to this new file in the pom.xml:
>  
>  4.0.0 
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  jar 
>  Maven Quick Start Archetype 
>  http://maven.apache.org 
>  
>  
>  junit 
>  junit 
>  3.8.1 
>  test 
>  
>  
>  
>  
>  src/main/filters/filter.properties 
>  
>  
>  
>  src/main/resources 
>  true 
>  
>  
>  
>  
> Then, if we add a reference to this property in the application.properties file:
> # application.properties
> application.name=${pom.name}
> application.version=${pom.version}
> message=${my.filter.value}
> the next execution of the mvn process-resources command will put our new property value into application.properties. As an alternative to defining the my.filter.value property in an external file, you could also have defined it in the properties section of your pom.xml and you'd get the same effect (notice I don't need the references to src/main/filters/filter.properties either):
>  
>  4.0.0 
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  jar 
>  Maven Quick Start Archetype 
>  http://maven.apache.org 
>  
>  
>  junit 
>  junit 
>  3.8.1 
>  test 
>  
>  
>  
>  
>  
>  src/main/resources 
>  true 
>  
>  
>  
>  
>  hello 
>  
>  
> Filtering resources can also get values from system properties; either the system properties built into Java (like java.version or user.home) or properties defined on the command line using the standard Java -D parameter. To continue the example, let's change our application.properties file to look like this:
> # application.properties
> java.version=${java.version}
> command.line.prop=${command.line.prop}
> Now, when you execute the following command (note the definition of the command.line.prop property on the command line), the application.properties file will contain the values from the system properties.
> mvn process-resources "-Dcommand.line.prop=hello again"
> How do I use external dependencies?
> You've probably already noticed a dependencies element in the POM we've been using as an example. You have, in fact, been using an external dependency all this time, but here we'll talk about how this works in a bit more detail. For a more thorough introduction, please refer to our Introduction to Dependency Mechanism.
> The dependencies section of the pom.xml lists all of the external dependencies that our project needs in order to build (whether it needs that dependency at compile time, test time, run time, or whatever). Right now, our project is depending on JUnit only (I took out all of the resource filtering stuff for clarity):
>  
>  4.0.0 
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  jar 
>  Maven Quick Start Archetype 
>  http://maven.apache.org 
>  
>  
>  junit 
>  junit 
>  3.8.1 
>  test 
>  
>  
>  
> For each external dependency, you'll need to define at least 4 things: groupId, artifactId, version, and scope. The groupId, artifactId, and version are the same as those given in the pom.xml for the project that built that dependency. The scope element indicates how your project uses that dependency, and can be values like compile, test, and runtime. For more information on everything you can specify for a dependency, see the Project Descriptor Reference.
> For more information about the dependency mechanism as a whole, see Introduction to Dependency Mechanism.
> With this information about a dependency, Maven will be able to reference the dependency when it builds the project. Where does Maven reference the dependency from? Maven looks in your local repository (~/.m2/repository is the default location) to find all dependencies. In a previous section, we installed the artifact from our project (my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the local repository. Once it's installed there, another project can reference that jar as a dependency simply by adding the dependency information to its pom.xml:
>  
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-other-app 
> ...
>  
> ...
>  
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  compile 
>  
>  
>  
> What about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my local repository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't available in the local repository, Maven will download the dependency from a remote repository into the local repository. You probably noticed Maven downloading a lot of things when you built your very first project (these downloads were dependencies for the various plugins used to build the project). By default, the remote repository Maven uses can be found (and browsed) at http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/. You can also set up your own remote repository (maybe a central repository for your company) to use instead of or in addition to the default remote repository.

> Let's add another dependency to our project. Let's say we've added some logging to the code and need to add log4j as a dependency. First, we need to know what the groupId, artifactId, and version are for log4j. We can browse ibiblio and look for it, or use Google to help by searching for "site:www.ibiblio.org maven2 log4j". The search shows a directory called /maven2/log4j/log4j (or /pub/packages/maven2/log4j/log4j). In that directory is a file called maven-metadata.xml. Here's what the maven-metadata.xml for log4j looks like:
>  
>  log4j 
>  log4j 
>  1.1.3 
>  
>  
>  1.1.3 
>  1.2.4 
>  1.2.5 
>  1.2.6 
>  1.2.7 
>  1.2.8 
>  1.2.11 
>  1.2.9 
>  1.2.12 
>  
>  
>  
> From this file, we can see that the groupId we want is "log4j" and the artifactId is "log4j". We see lots of different version values to choose from; for now, we'll just use the latest version, 1.2.12 (some maven-metadata.xml files may also specify which version is the current release version). Alongside the maven-metadata.xml file, we can see a directory corresponding to each version of the log4j library. Inside each of these, we'll find the actual jar file (e.g. log4j-1.2.12.jar) as well as a pom file (this is the pom.xml for the dependency, indicating any further dependencies it might have and other information) and another maven-metadata.xml file. There's also an md5 file corresponding to each of these, which contains an MD5 hash for these files. You can use this to authenticate the library or to figure out which version of a particular library you may be using already.
> Now that we know the information we need, we can add the dependency to our pom.xml:
>  
>  4.0.0 
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  jar 
>  Maven Quick Start Archetype 
>  http://maven.apache.org 
>  
>  
>  junit 
>  junit 
>  3.8.1 
>  test 
>  
>  
>  log4j 
>  log4j 
>  1.2.12 
>  compile 
>  
>  
>  
> Now, when we compile the project (mvn compile), we'll see Maven download the log4j dependency for us.
> How do I deploy my jar in my remote repository?
> For deploying jars to an external repository, you have to configure the repository url in the pom.xml and the authentication information for connectiong to the repository in the settings.xml.
> Here is an example using scp and username/password authentication:
>  
>  4.0.0 
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  jar 
>  Maven Quick Start Archetype 
>  http://maven.apache.org 
>  
>  
>  junit 
>  junit 
>  3.8.1 
>  test 
>  
>  
>  org.apache.codehaus.plexus 
>  plexus-utils 
>  1.0.4 
>

>  mycompany-repository 
>  MyCompany Repository 
>  scp://repository.mycompany.com/repository/maven2

>  
>  
>  mycompany-repository 
>  jvanzyl 
>  
>  /path/to/identity (default is ~/.ssh/id_dsa)
>  my_key_passphrase 
>  
>  
> ...
>  
> Note that if you are connecting to an openssh ssh server which has the parameter "PasswordAuthentication" set to "no" in the sshd_confing, you will have to type your password each time for username/password authentication (although you can log in using another ssh client by typing in the username and password). You might want to switch to public key authentication in this case.
> Care should be taken if using passwords in settings.xml. For more information, see Password Encryption.
> How do I create documentation?
> To get you jump started with Maven's documentation system you can use the archetype mechanism to generate a site for your existing project using the following command:
> mvn archetype:generate \
> -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
> -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-site \
> -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app \
> -DartifactId=my-app-site
> Now head on over to the Guide to creating a site to learn how to create the documentation for your project.
> How do I build other types of projects?
> Note that the lifecycle applies to any project type. For example, back in the base directory we can create a simple web application:
> mvn archetype:generate \
> -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
> -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp \
> -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app \
> -DartifactId=my-webapp
> Note that these must all be on a single line. This will create a directory called my-webapp containing the following project descriptor:
>  
>  4.0.0 
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-webapp 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  war 
>  
>  
>  junit 
>  junit 
>  3.8.1 
>  test 
>  
>  
>  
>  my-webapp 
>  
>  
> Note the element - this tells Maven to build as a WAR. Change into the webapp project's directory and try:
> mvn clean package
> You'll see target/my-webapp.war is built, and that all the normal steps were executed.
> How do I build more than one project at once?
> The concept of dealing with multiple modules is built in to Maven 2.0. In this section, we will show how to build the WAR above, and include the previous JAR as well in one step.
> Firstly, we need to add a parent pom.xml file in the directory above the other two, so it should look like this:
> +- pom.xml
> +- my-app
> | +- pom.xml
> | +- src
> | +- main
> | +- java
> +- my-webapp
> | +- pom.xml
> | +- src
> | +- main
> | +- webapp
> The POM file you'll create should contain the following:
>  
>  4.0.0 
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  pom 
>  
>  my-app 
>  my-webapp 
>  
>  
> We'll need a dependency on the JAR from the webapp, so add this to my-webapp/pom.xml:
> ...
>  
>  
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  my-app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  
> ...
>  
> Finally, add the following element to both of the other pom.xml files in the subdirectories:
>  
>  
>  com.mycompany.app 
>  app 
>  1.0-SNAPSHOT 
>  
> ...
> Now, try it... from the top level directory, run:
> mvn clean install
> The WAR has now been created in my-webapp/target/my-webapp.war, and the JAR is included:
> $ jar tvf my-webapp/target/my-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war

> How does this work? Firstly, the parent POM created (called app), has a packaging of pom and a list of modules defined. This tells Maven to run all operations over the set of projects instead of just the current one (to override this behaviour, you can use the --non-recursive command line option).
> Next, we tell the WAR that it requires the my-app JAR. This does a few things: it makes it available on the classpath to any code in the WAR (none in this case), it makes sure the JAR is always built before the WAR, and it indicates to the WAR plugin to include the JAR in its library directory.
> You may have noticed that junit-3.8.1.jar was a dependency, but didn't end up in the WAR. The reason for this is the test element - it is only required for testing, and so is not included in the web application as the compile time dependency my-app is.
> The final step was to include a parent definition. This is different to the extend element you may be familiar with from Maven 1.0: this ensures that the POM can always be located even if the project is distributed separately from its parent by looking it up in the repository.
> Unlike Maven 1.0, it is not required that you run install to successfully perform these steps - you can run package on its own and the artifacts in the reactor will be used from the target directories instead of the local repository.

> Wrapper scripts are a set of files that can be added to your Maven project.
> If people want to build this project, they don't need to install Maven first.
> Instead they can call the Maven wrapper script (like mvnw / mvnw.cmd ), which will download and unpack Maven into their ${user.home}/.m2/wrapper/dists folder.
> It is also an easy way to let everyone build the project with the same Maven version. 
>  The Apache Maven Wrapper Plugin makes it easier to add these wrapper scripts to your project. 
>  The scripts work like this: 
>  
>  download the maven-wrapper jar, if it is not available yet, 
>  the maven-wrapper.jar contains the code to download, install and run Apache Maven 
>  
>  Apache Maven Wrapper Distribution Types 
>  There are 4 distribution types available: 
>  
>  
>  only-script (default for new installations) : the lite implementation of mvnw / mvnw.cmd scripts will download the maven directly via wget or curl on *nix, or PowerShell on Windows,
> then exec/call the original mvn / mvn.cmd scripts of the downloaded maven distribution. This type does not use maven-wrapper.jar nor MavenWrapperDownloader.java ,
> only the wrapper scripts are required. 
>  
>  
>  script : With this type the scripts will try to download the scripts via wget or curl in case of Unix based system, or use Powershell in case of Windows 
>  
>  
>  bin : With this type the maven-wrapper jar is already available in the .mvn/wrapper folder, so you don't have to rely on wget/curl or Powershell
> The downside is that the project will contain a binary file in the source control management system. 
>  
>  
>  source : Since Maven already requires Java to run, why not compile and run a classfile to download the maven-wrapper jar?
> This type comes with a .mvn/wrapper/MavenWrapperDownloader.java which will be compiled and executed on the fly. 
>  
>  
>  The type can be specified with mvn wrapper:wrapper -Dtype={type} , where {type} is any of the types listed above. 
>  When wrapper:wrapper is run in a Maven module which contains a .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties file, then the distribution type of the existing Maven Wrapper is used for the execution of the goal.
> This allows updating Maven Wrapper, without unintentionally changing the distribution type for an existing project.
> You can still use -Dtype={type} to change the distribution type for an existing installation. 
>  Maven Version 
>  By default the plugin will assume the same version as the Maven runtime (calling mvn -v ). But you can pick a different version.
> You can call mvn wrapper:wrapper -Dmaven=x , where x is any valid Apache Maven Release (see Maven Central ).
> Another option is to adjust the distributionUrl in .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties . 
>  Debugging 
>  The apache-maven-wrapper distributions all contains the mvnwDebug -script for both Windows and Unix based operating systems.
> This makes it possible to debug through Apache Maven, Maven Plugin or Maven Extension.
> You can include these scripts by calling mvn wrapper:wrapper -DincludeDebug=true

>  Java Code Style 
>  Maven adopts the palantir Java format . 
>  Java Code Convention 
>  For consistency reasons, our Java code convention is mainly: 
>  
>  Naming : Constants (i.e. static final members) should always be in upper case. Use short, descriptive names for classes and methods. 
>  Organization : Avoid using public inner classes. Prefer interfaces instead of default implementation. 
>  Modifier : Avoid using final modifier on all fields and arguments. Prefer using private or protected fields instead of public fields. 
>  Exceptions : Throw meaningful exceptions to make debugging and testing easier. 
>  Documentation : Document public interfaces well, i.e. all non-trivial public and protected functions should include Javadoc that indicates what they do. 
>  Testing : All non-trivial public classes should have corresponding unit or integration tests. 
>  Java Code Convention - import layouts 
>  For consistency reasons, Java imports should be organized as: 
>  
>  import javax.* 
>  import java.* 
>  blank line 
>  import all other imports 
>  all imports in each group should be sorted alphabetically. 
>  To ensure a package import order consistent with the layout described above, download maven-eclipse-importorder.txt , select Window &gt; Preferences and navigate to Java &gt; Code Style &gt; Organize Imports . Click on Import... and select the downloaded file to change the import order. 
>  JavaDoc Convention 
>  TO BE DISCUSSED 
>  XML 
>  XML Code Style 
>  The Maven style for XML files is mainly: 
>  
>  Indentation : Always use 2 space indents, unless you're wrapping a new XML tags line in which case you should indent 4 spaces. 
>  Line Breaks : Always use a new line with indentation for complex XML types and no line break for simple XML types. Always use a new line to separate XML sections or blocks, for instance:
>  &lt;aTag&gt;
> &lt;simpleType&gt;This is a simple type&lt;/simpleType&gt;
> &lt;complexType&gt;
> &lt;simpleType&gt;This is a complex type&lt;/simpleType&gt;
> &lt;/complexType&gt;
> &lt;/aTag&gt; 
>  In some cases, adding comments could improve the readability of blocks, for instance: 
>  &lt;!-- Simple XML documentation --&gt;

>  This variable contains parameters used to start up the JVM running Maven and

>  This directory is part of the project and may be checked in into your version control. 
>  .mvn/extensions.xml file: 
>  The old way (up to Maven 3.2.5) was to create a jar (must be shaded if you have other dependencies) which contains the extension and put
> it manually into the ${MAVEN_HOME}/lib/ext directory. This means you had to change the Maven installation. The consequence was that everyone

> options to your Maven build every time you are calling Maven. Not very convenient as well. 
>  From now on this can be done much more simpler and in a more Maven like way. So you can define an .mvn/extensions.xml file which looks like the following: 
>  
>  &lt;extensions xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/EXTENSIONS/1.1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

> &lt;groupId/&gt;
> &lt;artifactId/&gt;
> &lt;version/&gt;
> &lt;/extension&gt;
> &lt;/extensions&gt;
>  
>  Now you can simply use an extension by defining the usual maven coordinates groupId, artifactId, version as any other artifact. Furthermore all transitive dependencies of those extensions will automatically being downloaded from your repository. So no need to create a shaded artifact anymore. 
>  .mvn/maven.config file: 
>  It’s really hard to define a general set of options for calling the maven command line. Starting with Maven 3.3.1+, this can be solved by
> putting this
> options to a script but this can now simple being done by defining .mvn/maven.config file which contains the
> configuration options for the mvn command line. 
>  For example things like -T3 -U --fail-at-end . So you only have to call Maven just by using mvn clean package instead of mvn -T3 -U --fail-at-end clean package and not to miss the -T3 -U --fail-at-end options on every call.
> The .mvn/maven.config is located in the project's top level .mvn directory also works if in the root of a multi module build. 
>  NOTICE starting with Maven 3.9.0 each single argument must be put in new line, so for the mentioned example your file will have content like: 
>  
>  .mvn/jvm.config file: 
>  Starting with Maven 3.3.1+ you can define JVM configuration via .mvn/jvm.config file which means you can define the options for your build on a per project base.
> This file will become part of your project and will be checked in along with your project.
> So no need anymore for MAVEN_OPTS , .mavenrc files. 
>  So for example if you put the following JVM options into the .mvn/jvm.config file 
>  
>  -Xmx2048m -Xms1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Djava.awt.headless=true
>

>  Maven's Objectives 
>  Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete
> state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order
> to attain this goal, Maven deals with several areas of concern: 
>  
>  Making the build process easy 
>  Providing a uniform build system 
>  Providing quality project information 
>  Encouraging better development practices 
>  
>  Making the build process easy 
>  While using Maven doesn't eliminate the need to know about the
> underlying mechanisms, Maven does shield developers from many details. 
>  Providing a uniform build system 
>  Maven builds a project using its project object model (POM) and
> a set of plugins. Once you familiarize yourself with one Maven
> project, you know how all Maven projects build.
> This saves time when navigating many projects. 
>  Providing quality project information 
>  Maven provides useful project information that is in part
> taken from your POM and in part generated from your project's sources.
> For example, Maven can provide: 
>  
>  Change log created directly from source control 
>  Cross referenced sources 
>  Mailing lists managed by the project 
>  Dependencies used by the project 
>  Unit test reports including coverage 
>  
>  Third party code analysis products also provide Maven plugins that add their

>  For example, specification, execution, and reporting of unit tests are
> part of the normal build cycle using Maven. Current unit testing best
> practices were used as guidelines: 
>  
>  Keeping test source code in a separate, but parallel source tree 
>  Using test case naming conventions to locate and execute tests 
>  Having test cases setup their environment instead of
> customizing the build for test preparation 
>  
>  Maven also assists in project workflow such as release and issue management. 
>  Maven also suggests some guidelines on how to layout your project's
> directory structure. Once you learn the layout, you can easily

>  While Maven takes an opinionated approach to project layout, some projects
> may not fit with this structure for historical reasons. While Maven is
> designed to be flexible to the needs of different projects,
> it cannot cater to every situation without compromising its objectives. 
>  If your project has an unusual build structure that

#### _Assistant_

> Okay, given the project structure and the technologies we're using (Java, Maven, JUnit, and the intention to keep it "pure Java"), here's a `.gitignore` file that's appropriate for your `atproto-java` project.  I'll explain the reasoning behind each entry.

> **Explanation of Entries:**
> 
> *   **`target/`:**  This is *the* most important entry.  Maven builds everything into the `target` directory.  This includes compiled classes, generated JARs, test reports, generated documentation, etc.  You *never* want to commit build artifacts to your Git repository.
> *   **`.m2/repository/`:** This line is *commented out* by default, but it's *highly recommended* to uncomment it for general Maven projects. This directory is where Maven stores downloaded dependencies (JARs from Maven Central, etc.).  Including this directory ensures that all developers are working with the same dependencies and external repos. Including would make each developer have to do a lengthy download that could be prone to error.
> *  **IDE-Specific Folders and Files:**
>     *   **`.idea/`, `*.iml`, `*.ipr`, `*.iws`:**  These are for IntelliJ IDEA.  These files store project-specific settings for a single user, and these should not be version controlled since other users may have different IDEs.
>     *   **`.classpath`, `.project`, `.settings/`:** These are for Eclipse.  These files are similar to IntelliJ's and should not be stored in a project designed to be open source or used potentially across diverse dev teams.
>     *    **`.nbproject`, `.nb-gradle/`, `build/`:** These directories are for Netbeans.
>     *   **`.vscode/`**: This is for VS Code.
> *   **OS-Generated Files:**
>     *   **`.DS_Store`:** macOS Finder metadata files.  These are hidden files that store icon positions, window sizes, etc.  They are irrelevant to the project.
>     *   **`Thumbs.db`:** Windows thumbnail cache files.  Similar to `.DS_Store`, they are OS-specific and not part of the project.
> *   **Backup Files:**
>     *   **`*.bak`, `*.swp`, `*~`, `*.orig`:**  These are common extensions for backup or temporary files created by various text editors and tools.  They are almost never needed in the repository.
> *    **Logs**
>   	*	**`*.log`**: Log files should generally be ignored.
> *    **Byte code and compiled resources:**
>   	*   	**`*.class, *.war, *.ear, *.zip, *.tar.gz, *.rar`** These are created during builds and should not be stored.
> *   **`dependency-reduced-pom.xml`:** Maven sometimes generates this file during builds.  It's a modified POM; don't commit it.
> *   **`buildNumber.properties`:** Used by the `buildnumber-maven-plugin` , this should not be committed.
> *   **`.mvn/timing.properties`:** Used by Maven, this stores time-based performance metrics, this is not designed to, nor should be, stored in Git.
> *   **Maven Wrapper (Conditional):**
>     *   **`.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar`:** *Usually* you *do* commit the Maven Wrapper files to your repository.  However, you *might* choose not to if you have specific reasons (e.g., extremely strict security policies forbidding any binaries in the repo).  *If* you decide not to commit the JAR, then this line *should* be uncommented.
>     *   **`!.mvn/wrapper/MavenWrapperDownloader.java`:** If you're using the "source" distribution of the Maven Wrapper, you *do* want to commit the `MavenWrapperDownloader.java` file.  The `!` negates the ignore rule. This is commented out by default because the binary JAR is the more common approach.
>     * **`.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties`:** This is text file that has maven-wrapper settings, so it should be stored.
>     *   **`mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd`:**  These are the Maven Wrapper shell scripts (Unix and Windows, respectively).  You *almost always* want to commit these.
> 
> * **Javadoc**
> 	*	**`docs/api`** Typically if you are compiling javadoc, it goes here and you don't store it in your project repo.
> 
> **How to Use This `.gitignore`:**
> 
> 1.  **Create the file:** Create a new file named `.gitignore` (exactly that name, including the leading dot) in the root of your `atproto-java` project (the same directory as your `pom.xml`).
> 2.  **Copy and paste:** Copy the contents of the code block above into the `.gitignore` file.
> 3.  **Uncomment as needed:**  Read the comments carefully, especially regarding the Maven Wrapper.  If you decide *not* to commit the `maven-wrapper.jar`, uncomment that line.  If you *are* committing the JAR (which is recommended), leave it commented.
> 4. **Add and Commit**: Add and then commit this to your GitHub. By default, the files specified in the `.gitignore` won't be noticed by Git and won't risk accidental inclusion.
> 
> This `.gitignore` file is a good starting point. As your project grows and you add more tools or libraries, you might need to add more entries. But this covers the vast majority of common cases for a Java/Maven project.
